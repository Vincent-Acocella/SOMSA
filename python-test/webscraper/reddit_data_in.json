{"U.N. Reclassifies Cannabis as a Less Dangerous Drug": ["Great news. Hopefully a lot of good research comes out of it. It's good and bad. It means the pharmaceutical companies and the FDA are sure to strong arm their way into it. Putting the brave people who fought for the legalization out of business. The most dangerous thing about weed is getting caught with it. I've said this for years, and it's true. But I'm also ready to reclassify this claim when it becomes truly legal everywhere. Once weed is truly legal, I'll be able to say that these are the issues with using it, and discuss responsible use. None of them are as bad as the anti-drug people make them out to be, so the discussion doesn't really get anywhere as long as they're still pulling that shit. But once they finally lose and let it be legal, then we can talk about the issues with using it too early in life, using it chronically, using it in high doses chronically, long term chronic use and other legitimate aspects of use. It's the same as sugar. If sugar was illegal the worst thing about it would be the dangers of getting caught with it. But with sugar legal we can instead talk about the risks of too much. Eating too much can make you fat. Eating sugar can rot your teeth. Even without getting fat, it changes your blood sugar level. That has a cascade effect on your body. Etc. There are legitimate considerations for using sugar. Same with pot. But we can't even discuss things like stunting your emotional maturity because you started smoking daily at 11 because even mentioning this has people thinking you're in the pro-prohibition camp with the zealots. I work as a nurse on a mental health unit, while IMHO, weed is definitely far from the worse, it can still help induce or increase psychotic symptoms or increase depressive symptoms in many people especially if you already have a mental health issue. So if one can chose, you should pick cbd and not thc. However, if you want to get fucked up in your head, have full blown psychosis and meeting people like me, do take meth/amphetamines. This will definitely mess you up way more. (obviously, I'm excluding psychostimulants prescribed by you doctor in proper dosage.) In Canada the most dangerous thing about weed here is to stuff the bag upside down in your pocket and end up with a pocket full of weed and weed full of lint and pocket crumbs. My mom still considers it a gateway drug. And i wish we would just have edibles that way it\u2019s super safe and doesn\u2019t have the harmful lung effects from smoking. Literally put it in snacks and stfu and tax the hell out of it We\u2019re lucky alcohol wasn\u2019t like this because it\u2019s a hell of a lot more deadly and actually kills people Me in High School: Let's go to that abandoned bakery and smoke weed in the alley way... What was that noise?! Me now in a legal state: Are we going to Target? Hold on, let me grab my vape. Have to quit weed currently because it causes extreme anxiety and my heart rate goes up to 150 bpm at rest every time I smoke. Been a week and I still have anxiety, I feel like my body is in a constant fight or flight response and my chest feels very 'airy' and butterflies in my stomach. It's also difficult to sleep like this. I feel/think like I have extreme health problems and my heart will fail (I turned into hypochondriac) while I consciously know that is totally not true, I am perfectly healthy besides these feelings. This is with very heavy use though, a gram or more daily for years. With that, I think getting caught with it here in NJ is still a lot worse and will fuck up your life way more than anxiety. It also causes chs which is excruciating stomach pain but it is not very common. I probably will smoke again one day but not anytime in the foreseeable future.. This is the best tl;dr I could make,   reduced by 80%. (I'm a bot) Dec. 2, 2020, 6:11 a.m. ET.A United Nations commission voted on Wednesday to remove cannabis for medical use from a category of the world's most dangerous drugs, such as heroin, a highly anticipated and long-delayed decision that could clear the way for marijuana research and medical use. \"We will have the U.N., the main drug policy body, recognizing the medical usefulness of cannabis,\" he said ahead of the vote. The overhaul of cannabis policy, particularly around legalization for medical use, has moved at a rapid pace over the last few years, said Jessica Steinberg, managing director at the Global C, an international cannabis consulting group, who has attended U.N. meetings.  |   |   |    :          So funny that Weed and Heroin were classed together but Pharmaceutical use of opiates has remained so prevalent and Pot has been so neglected. The schedules described here and NOT the same as the DEA's in the USA. Guys marijuana is really dangerous. If a person smokes 20,000 joints in 15 minutes they can die. Let us not forget to inform all the helicopter parents that it\u2019s not due to weed, it\u2019s due to a lack of oxygen that kills you. Don\u2019t need any parents in here reading this going \u201cmy Danny boy is a super smoker, he probably could smoke that much in 15 minutes\u201d. It\u2019s ridiculous that we have to inform them That 50s \u201cweed kills brain cells\u201d study was done by pumping constant smoke into a gas mask worn by a monkey. It\u2019s easier to OD from \u201ctoo much smoke, not enough air\u201d than \u201ctoo much smoke, too much THC in bloodstream\u201d Challenge accepted And even then it\u2019s not the weed that kills you. It\u2019s all that deeeelicious cookie dough Also if you eat a pot brownie you could choke on it and die that way! The fact that cannabis was on a list of dangerous drugs in the first place is absurd atleast in one category with heroin etc, I mean cmon, its weed Why is the UN classifying drugs in the first place? The UN has 4 main purposes: To keep peace throughout the world To develop friendly relations among nations To help nations work together to improve the lives of poor people, to conquer hunger, disease and illiteracy, and to encourage respect for each other\u2019s rights and freedoms To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve these goals I\u2019ve heard of lolly popping, but those boys in that picture gave those girls the full high bald fade. Pretty damn early too.  No fluff buds for them I guess? Exactly, far too extreme...and they also lost a month vegging them so big in the first place The fact that entire nations were ok with pretending cannabis was harmful shows you everything you need to know about people in power. About the people that   in power, and the uninformed inertia of public support they mustered decades ago. Some ban-hammer-happy powerful racists make weed super-illegal and convinced a huge section of the public to go along with it. Now I would be surprised if anyone in power   cares about weed, half of them regularly do much more powerful stuff, what they think is that being anti-weed is a vote winner in some circles. As this becomes less and less true and the court of public opinion turns in favor of weed, power will follow. But there's NO way they'd ever use that same tactic with other mediums outside of pot.. /s Just make it legal already. Tired of hiding and smoking Good stuff I UN Thank you for dropping the schedule of marijuana It makes ZERO sense as to why it was in the first place It makes ZERO sense as to why it was in the first place Money and control. Plain and simple. Because Nixon couldn't make being a hippie or a civil rights protester or being black illegal,  Regan ramped the whole thing up to 11 and now we have an entire prison industrial complex to fight against decriminalization of largely harmless plants. America was settled by puritans and that way of life still lingers today! I'm an american in oklahoma and have a medical card! My statement still stands that puritan values still linger today! Read this book, it will explain what happened. Actually it was a very effective way to control people of color and poor economic standing. Look into William Randald Hurst. Capitalism x Bigotry I hope psychedelics will follow Also for these substances, it makes no sense it makes sense if you know the history of it! Obvious.  Weed makes you see.  It removes the anxiety that the overlords impose on you. Because of pressure from the US. I wonder if this is an early sign of the States losing some of its global influence. Great, so governments with all their resources are just figuring out what we all knew.  Better late than never I guess. governments [...] just figuring out what we all knew do not mistake corruption for incompetence. Great, so governments with all their resources are just   admitting what we all knew because a business model is in play. Sometimes I like to plagiarize and add a few of my own words. I guess being part of the government and being a pothead doesnt go hand in hand. You cant forget, that even the people controlling the narrative were being controlled by the narrative. Most of these old fucks probably sincerely think weed is dangerous. Getting closer.  Fact is, cannabis is more correctly classified as a useful plant, with an extremely favorable safety profile. Now do psilocybin. Psychedelics in general. But i think its wiser to start with the natural ones (mescaline, dmt and psilocybin) because people they have less stigma and thousands of years of safe use. Shrooms are an amazing drug. Had severe anxiety growing up and high school was the worst. Also had fear of animals and insects. Started experimenting with Psilocybin and pretty much made me stop giving a fuck about being anxious and I pick up lizards and frogs up without freaking out. Though if youre not ready for it, it can be self destructive if you bullshit yourself. Best analogy I heard was \"its like taking a big mental shit, four months of therapy in four hours.\" And do LSD, MDMA, 2C-B, DMT, 4-Aco-DMT, 5-Meo-DMT, mescaline, LSA, ETH-LAD, etc As much as I want to see the new marijuana industry not be dominated by big ag/pharma i cant wait to smoke the super weed monsanto is working on It\u2019s insane how the four legal plants I have growing 5 feet away from me has put so many people in jail yet it\u2019s no where near as dangerous as alcohol. What strains? I recently started growing and it's actually really sad that cannabis has been outlawed the way it has. It's such a beautiful plant. And it has missed out on decades of proper scientific breeding. Imagine the medicine and quality of herb we'd be growing if people were allowed to really study this plant. And yet GA will arrest you for possession of any amount. Mindblowing Iowa is right there with you. What\u2019s more dangerous- THC or Alcohol (ethanol)? Asking for a friend. Alcohol. Alcohol withdrawal can kill you real fast Alcohol is by far the more dangerous drug, by many orders of magnitude. It's effects on people's bodies, on their behaviour, and on society writ large are astronomically worse than the impacts of cannabis. What makes it worse, in my view, is that alcohol is socially revered. We celebrate its effects, we glamorize it, we joke with our friends and colleagues about how much we need it, we laugh at  people who are severely intoxicated by it, we gloss over the damaging effects it has on ourselves and others, we think of it as a go-to solution to stressful life situations, we create cute language (e.g. mommy needs her wine!) to soften what is an addictive and dangerous drug. Alcohol is one of the few drugs that, in many cultures, you need an excuse *not* to use. Cannabis is not harmless, but it is not in the same league as alcohol. If you were objectively examining cannabis and alcohol and deciding which one should be illegal, no reasonable person would have concluded cannabis. Both have their risks, but weed doesn't kill. The NHS did a great study on lots of drugs finding their harm to self, harm to others, risk of abuse, etc. It's the source to go to for now and the right way to think about these things. The harms to the individual were: drug-specific mortality drug-related mortality drug-specific damage drug-related damage dependence drug-specific impairment of mental functioning drug-related impairment of mental functioning loss of tangibles (income, housing, job etc) loss of relationships The harms to others were: injury crime environmental damage family adversities international damage economic cost community The only dangerous thing about weed is getting caught with it Alchohol is definitely more dangerous. Alcohol. I don\u2019t think anyone denies that alcohol is more dangerous, but that doesn\u2019t mean that weed not harmful. There are multiple studies that show the negative effects that weed have. So why should we make something that is proven harmful legal? And yes regarding some cases like cancer and chronic pain, weed has proven useful and I think that it should be an option for the patient. But I\u2019m pretty certain that the majority of weed consumers don\u2019t suffer from cancer or chronic pain, they just want to get high. Alcohol is worse Bye-bye boomers. Times are changing. Caffeine is also a less dangerous drug, wonder if same category There's gotta be an alternate universe where coffee is banned and stoners meet up in secret to drink it, meanwhile congressmen smoke week for breakfast lmao. Conservative  Americans are why cannabis was outlawed world wide. They forced marijuana prohibition on America and then strong armed other countries into following suit. And yet drug loving Americans still vote conservative to own the Social Justice Warriors they hate so much. Fucking Americans. It is more because of the tobacco companies paying big bucks to show cannabis in bad light and paying politicians to shut down any attempt of legalization. The depressing thing is that today, at least at the federal level, it's a bipartisan effort to keep it outlawed. This is entirely incorrect. Weed prohibition had began before america was really even a legitimate country. People would bring marijuana products back from southeast asia, africa, and the middle east into europe which led to places such as france banning hashish. Pls dont be a dumbass and act like the USA is the only country to ever be shitty or racist or really bad about laws or whatever. U kinda just make urself look like a 12 year old who just started watching dr who or something. MAGA should be classified as a detrimental substance the green wave is upon us The tides are high today They need to do this with mushrooms and peyote. If more ppl were tripping and having these spiritual experiences I believe the world would be a much better and happier place. Granted everyone would be spun the fuck out but theirs minds would be opened up Oregon just passed a bill that allows  psilocybin mushrooms for use in treatment. We became the party state with legal weed and shrooms. Now do LSD, DMT and Psilocybin! The 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances is a joke. If cannabis is a drug, so is coffee and alcohol how does the UN classify ethanol? If it's not at least classified as a 'more dangerous drug' then the UN is even more of a joke, given the literally overwhemling consensus that alcohol is more addictive, does more societal harm, causes more overdoses and deaths, etc. Not to mention alcohol is a group 1 carcinogen. the main reason im even on reddit is that if i try to go without an account i always really wanna upvote these pot posts... so here goes This article gets one thing wrong: Experts say that the vote will have no immediate impact on loosening international controls because governments will still have jurisdiction over how to classify cannabis. But many countries look to global conventions for guidance, and United Nations recognition is a symbolic win for advocates of drug policy change who say that international law is out of date. Actually the 1961 Single Convention is a non-self-executing treaty, meaning that being party to it requires the state to pass legislation in support of it's terms. The 1970 Controlled Substances Act in the US, and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the UK, are both laws that were passed to comply with Single Convention obligations. Not that the US cares at all, but prior to this reclassification process rescheduling cannabis in the Single Convention, if the US had decriminalized cannabis federally they would have been in violation of their international obligations under the Single Convention. This is actually a HUGE step forward as now every state party to the Single Convention can update their laws accordingly. TLDR; This move essentially removes the international pressure to treat cannabis like a dangerous drug, and allows states parties to relax their cannabis laws with no UN/INCB pressure against. Specifically medical cannabis could now be legalized and regulated in most countries around the world. Why is it classified as dangerous at all? It was a political move to throw those that disagreed with Nixon in jail. Reagan later cranked it up for his own reasons. Drug schedules aren't actually related to the potential benefits/harmful effects of a substance. Let plants be plants and make laws about the use, banning plants is beyond retarded. As long as they call it a drug big pharma is getting what they want. Cool now liberate China Only about 60 years too late. tf took the idiots so long? Cool, now do alcohol if pot is still \"dangerous.\" YSK that Marijuana is a sacred herb in Hindu mythology. Lord Shiva used to consume it with his chillum. Unfortunately this became a banned substance even in India due to politics. While we can and certainly should debate the harmful effects and addiction, it has been found that it isn\u2019t as addictive or harmful as other recreational drugs. Taken in moderation, it really helps to calm the mind down. Don't people in India still consume Cannabis in the form of bhang? Is that also illegal? It is dangerous for my diet \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1d Damn at first I read this as the US. Bitch McConnell needs to die so we can have nice things I'm sorry but I think there's a typo in your comment. It should be Bitch McFuckface. Fuck research and benefits of drugs. Just let me do drug  regardless man. Lsd won\u2019t cure shit for me, it just makes watching Sfx in movies really fun. Why do we need research of medicinal benefits when it\u2019s just fun. Weed probably harms you more than it helps. That  fine IMO. Cause Alcohol does the same and I can buy that across the block but I gotta go on the outskirts of town to buy legal weed. Come one man. Weed isn\u2019t dangerous? of course it is. So what, I never gotten high enough to feel as shitty as I did drinking two four locos and you can get that at 711. I'll smoke to that \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf3f Why do those plants look like bonsai trees? They may want to hire someone who knows that they\u2019re doing. Mother plants - plants held in pre-flowering state to provide clone cuttings that are grown to flower - can often look like bonsai plants, I saw one in the Netherlands many years ago. They know what they're doing, but you just assume it's wrong because   don't know what they're doing lol. Puff Puff Puff...  but we're not there yet. To think that all of that suffering and injustice is mostly the product of racist and cultural supremacism considerations... Too many innocents died as the result of these pointless laws. Cannabis needs to be removed from any scheduled substance list. Excellent. Next step is to classify it as (mostly) harmless plant. Step by steady step. Advil is more dangerous than weed. Like alcohol and nicotine aren't worse... Thanks UN. Maybe now they can backtrack on the war against Psychedelics its happening..... Cmon Congress\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e It is nice to see these organisations and Governments finally catch up with the Stoners. Drug test this guy NOW HOW ABOUT WHO CARES OF THE MEDICAL USE? HOW ABOUT IT'S JUST FUN? AND NOT DANGEROUS IN ANY WAY What do they classify alcohol as? Is caffeine classified? It's about fucking time. Yeah it\u2019s pretty much medicine Bout fucking time Great! Now hopefully the US will drop it\u2019s schedule classification soon. I\u2019m interested to see the research that comes out about THC, especially looking more deeply into the links between it and increased psychosis or anxiety symptoms. I used to smoke weed. I still do, but i used to, to I\u2019m so sick of this pussyfooting the world does with marijuana... just make it fucking legal for Christ sake Meanwhile just sitting here ordering magic mushrooms online in Canada Everyone can thank NJ for this. Seems like ever since NJ legalized federal courts and the international courts followed suit. I\u2019m kidding but it\u2019s was weird timing. It\u2019s not a drug. It\u2019s a plant. And it was put on this planet to heal humanity. \"U.N. Reclassifies Cannabis as a Less Dangerous Drug A United Nations commission voted to remove marijuana for medical use from a list of the most risky narcotics, such as heroin. Tending crops at a marijuana plantation in North Macedonia. Tending crops at a marijuana plantation in North Macedonia.Credit...Loulou d'Aki for The New York Times Isabella Kwai By Isabella Kwai Dec. 2, 2020 Updated 10:10 a.m. ET A United Nations commission voted on Wednesday to remove cannabis for medicinal purposes from a category of the world\u2019s most dangerous drugs, a highly anticipated and long-delayed decision that could clear the way for an expansion of marijuana research and medical use. The vote by the Commission for Narcotic Drugs, which is based in Vienna and includes 53 member states, considered a series of recommendations from the World Health Organization on reclassifying cannabis and its derivatives. But attention centered on a key recommendation to remove cannabis from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs \u2014 where it was listed alongside dangerous and highly addictive opioids like heroin. Experts say that the vote will have no immediate impact on loosening international controls because governments will still have jurisdiction over how to classify cannabis. But many countries look to global conventions for guidance, and United Nations recognition is a symbolic win for advocates of drug policy change who say that international law is out of date. \u201cThis is a huge, historic victory for us, we couldn\u2019t hope for more,\u201d said Kenzi Riboulet-Zemouli, an independent researcher for drug policy who has closely monitored the vote and the position of member states. He said that cannabis had been used throughout history for medicinal purposes and that the decision on Wednesday reinstated that status. The change will most likely bolster medical research and legalization efforts around the world. The vote was a \u201cbig step forward,\u201d recognizing the positive impact of cannabis on patients, said Dirk Heitepriem, a vice president at Canopy Growth, a Canadian cannabis company. \u201cWe hope this will empower more countries to create frameworks which allow patients in need to get access to treatment.\u201d Marijuana for medical use has exploded in recent years and products containing cannabis derivatives like cannabidiol or CBD, a nonintoxicating compound, have flooded the wellness industry. Cowen, an investment and financial services company, estimates that the CBD industry in the United States will be worth $16 billion by 2025. Some research has suggested that CBD can protect the nervous system and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation. The list of CBD-infused products \u2014 including creams, serums, soda water and juice \u2014 is also expanding rapidly. The recommendations for changing the classification of marijuana were first made by the World Health Organization in 2019. But they were politically divisive, which led to unusual delays in the United Nations commission\u2019s vote. The reclassification passed 27 to 25, with an abstention from Ukraine. The United States and European nations were among those who voted in favor, while the likes of China, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan and Russia were opposed. China\u2019s delegate said that, despite the United Nations move, the country would strictly control cannabis \u201cto protect from the harm and abuse.\u201d Britain\u2019s delegate said that the reclassification was \u201cin line with the scientific evidence of its therapeutic benefits\u201d but that the country still strongly supported international controls for cannabis, adding that marijuana presented \u201cserious public health risks.\u201d The differing messages underline the complexities behind the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s been a diplomatic circus,\u201d said Mr. Riboulet-Zemouli, who added that some countries initially opposed to the change, like France, had since switched their position. Michael Krawitz, executive director for Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access, an advocacy group in the United States, said the change in international law would \u201chelp reduce the suffering millions of people\u201d and could help mitigate reliance on opiates, noting that cannabis was an important medication that could provide unique pain relief. Also on Wednesday, the commission rejected a proposal to include the cannabis derivative THC in the 1961 convention, which would have tightened some controls. The overhaul of cannabis policy, particularly around legalization for medical use, has moved at a rapid pace over the last few years, said Jessica Steinberg, managing director at the Global C, an international cannabis consulting group. Industry insiders have expressed hope that the vote will open the field for more research into the therapeutic benefits of the drug. But the impact on the American and European markets was driving the issue, Ms. Steinberg noted. In the United States, where more states legalized the use of medical and recreational marijuana in the recent election, the market for both of those is expected to expand to more than $34 billion by 2025, according to Cowen. Before the vote this week and other decriminalization efforts, share prices of some cannabis companies jumped. But aside from the financial boon it could provide for American and European marijuana markets, downgrading the dangers of cannabis may have the biggest impact on countries that have more conservative policies, such as many Caribbean and Asian nations. \u201cSomething like this does not mean that legalization is just going to happen around the world,\u201d Ms. Steinberg said. But \u201cit could be a watershed moment.\u201d \" Well Done them, hopefully it can be put to medical use, to help people who really need it. This is great. I'm lucky enough to live in Colorado where there are at least three dispensaries within two minutes of my apartment; and as a regular user both medically and recreationally, I can only hope that this paves the way for more innovation. So when it's convenient for you??? Fuck off un and any bs govt that peddled alcohol, nicotine and meds on every street corner for over a century. i use cannabis from time to time in various forms, but i still think we need to remember that just because it's becoming more legal, it's still not something we should have around kids, especially in a smoke-able form. second hand smoke is dangerous. I would think edibles/topicals would be more dangerous around children. 5 year old isn't likely to light up a joint. But those cookies or gummies look pretty appealing to a child. That's a fair compromise I'd say. Make it legal but punishable if you smoke round children or in the car with passengers present etc, kinda like how cigarettes are now (disregarding the fact that cigarettes are far more dangerous) i feel the same way cigarettes' but here we are. Is there recent literature showing it\u2019s unhealthy for children? More so than Nighttime Benadryl at least? Not saying it isn\u2019t. I am just skeptical. I\u2019ve been told my entire life it was a schedule 1 drugs (ie NO medicine benefits). And that was obviously bullshit. Truly a great day, the UN has finally gained the medical experience of a trailer park hippy in the 1970s. Why is it still referred to as a drug at all? The fucking government needs to start calling alcohol a drug. You can become dependent on alcohol and the shit will kill you. Marijuana not so much. It\u2019s all about money. They know they couldn\u2019t regulate and tax weed like they do alcohol so piss off with this whole shit show. THC and ethanol are both drugs. That classification isn't related to their potentially harmful/beneficial effects. They absolutely could regulate and tax it. But the tobacco industry keeps paying politicians to keep it out because who the fuck would smoke tobacco if weed was legal? Why dangerous at all? Blood pressure and heart rate increase in addition to various mental stability issues I\u2019d assume Thailand changed laws today also Blame Canada :) \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 Good move. My weed stocks :) pls continue. Are those weed bonsais?\ud83d\ude0d Pog! But didn\u2019t we know this already? I just hope good research keeps coming out Everytime I see the word cannabis, I read cannibal. Idiots finally realized. Took them long enough. disable javascript in chrome than reload the page. Fuck the NY Times It\u2019s about damn time That\u2019s a heavy prune...that\u2019s what I take away. how is it dangerous? Why isn\u2019t hemp becoming a thing now it is legal in some/most countries Oh god what did they do to those plants in the banner image? Talk about lollipop ping... Don\u2019t be fooled, they didn\u2019t classify it as \u201cless dangerous\u201d until it was convenient for them to do so. Where is alcohol on the list? About time! Less than 1% and he is doing next \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4 wabbo do dont dingdong Das macht es noch lange nicht zu Brokkoli! Interesting how this news is released after the talks of adding cancer warnings to alcohol products like beer and whiskey have circulated online Reminder, weed should still be taken responsibly. Start with edibles where you can easily control your dosage and start small until you know your tolerance. So many people smoke too much their first time and have a bad experience. It's the equivalent of drinking Everclear straight from the bottle for your first alcoholic beverage. Bad advice, starting with edibles is a recipe for disaster. There are too many factors to consider with edibles. Start with a dry herb vape if you have access to it, even distillate with low THC % can do the trick. Sublingual spray / oil is also more forgiving than edibles, start small. Shouldve been done like 10 years ago but okay.... Corporate Cannabis. Yeees finally!!! This single UN convention or whatever was the main thing the government brought up whenever we had a petition to legalize in our country! Which pissed me off, Canada signed that as well and went ahead with legalization, so why couldn't we?! Now they will at least have to make up their own reasons to keep it illegal instead of citing this 50 year old document back at us again and again. Yay for Weed Stocks! Just look at how happy *most Canadians are ! Thanks captain obvious I smoke everyday...still don't have the urge to try stronger drugs. All those anti drug commercials were   its more like  Article and UN decision aside, how stupid are the growers in the photo? Like what the fuck are those? Butchered the plants lol. Fucking finally. After the US bullied them to upgrade drugs like LSD and marijuana up the list Until cannabis is classified as less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco they can\u2019t be taken seriously. \u270a\ud83c\udffd I guess theyre getting closer to finding a way to effectively tax the shit out of it Damn, the UN itself? Oh wait, noone will care Wow that photo is wholesome af. How does that affect legislation in UN friendly countries? How about not dangerous at all! Great! Now let\u2019s expunge the records of those who were jailed for years. Less dangerous than? Alcohol? Prescription pain killers? No no, they straight up had it on a list that included Heroin. To be fair, if we\u2019re weighting this comparison based on relative danger to health, alcohol, pain killers, and heroin all belong on the same list. A list titled  That\u2019s an interesting growing technique I see in the picture, anyone have any idea what that is called? About time Finally...they\u2019re catching on The UN doing anything literally means nothing And uh when was it dangerous? When it was threatening big companies and Nixon?

{"UK approves Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine for mass roll out": ["Around 10m doses should be available soon, with the first 800,000 arriving in the UK in the coming days. I wonder how much of that is stock they have been building up while waiting for approval, and what the production capacity is.  It is still a good quick start to immunise frontline workers. Pfizer said they can produce 80m doses this year and up to 1.3B doses next year. They will have been producing these and other promising vaccine candidates in expectation of the green light for a fast rollout. Sorry, scalpers have already stockpiled all the vaccines using bots. If you want one now you have to buy them on Ebay or Marketplace. United airlines has already begun to fly and distribute the Pfizer vaccine at least to the US. Multiple 777s have been bringing over vaccines from Brussels to United\u2019s hub in Chicago since last Friday. Insane logistical hurdle to fly with dry ice to make it happen There's a great Freakonomics about vaccines. Well worth a listen. Countries have been pre ordering vaccines from multiple pharma's in the millions. They're basically funding a lot of the work and manufacturing. almost all of it, they started mass-producing it as soon as they had something ready for testing I think That is part of the reason this is available so fast. They had a positive initial sample, and immediately started production on that vaccine. If it didn\u2019t work, all they lose is money. Normally, production of a vaccine does not start until all the trials are complete. In the before times, we would normally just be   production now. Here\u2019s a very interesting article for anyone curious! Also I really hope these historic vaccine successes help humanity appreciate biomedical science and public health more. We\u2019ve been taking it for granted far too long. But really, this is a proud day for humanity. Dude we can\u2019t even appreciate the original threat... Don\u2019t bode well for us appreciating the prevention. I was just thinking how I\u2019m feeling an inexplicable sense of pride right now and I just realised it\u2019s basically what you said. Pride in humanity. This is an incredible achievement and one of those   moments. Can't really be proud because for once we did the right thing even though it's probably for the wrong reasons. Yay, we were rational, awesome! /s This article makes it sound as if Pfizer had the longterm strategy to develop Corona mRNA vaccines and asked Biontech to help them. In fact BionTech developed a strategy which is called light speed, contacted German and European Institutions very early on, had already the working vaccine developed in January, when most of the Western world didn't even took Corona seriously and only contacted Pfizer in March to help them with testing. Thanks for sharing. That was a great article. Wow. To get a vaccine out THIS fast, is honestly an incredible achievement in human history. And it\u2019s an absolutely   vaccine too! Now imagine what we could do if we put this much effort and resources into solving the climate emergency. Arguably the much bigger threat to our existence. Edit because this comment has gained a little traction: I think how fast we found a solution for Covid-19 shows what we can achieve. It makes me hopeful we can also solve the climate crisis. If I had seen this headline in April omg no way They had a head start from the last 2 SARS, still impressive. It's a fast beta test. Hijacking top comment to bring a guide to different vaccine types, since there\u2019s so much misinformation. This is from Nature (a top scientific academic journal): This is what it looks like when scientosts are given unlimited funding to develop something What are the expectations on global travel resuming over the next 12 months with vaccine rollout now starting at the end of 2020? Say, From Australia to the UK, for example? I imagine it will gated behind either being vaccinated and/or having a recent negative test until the world is satisfied with how many are immunised Fuck yeah! Fuck off, Covid Fuck covid. All my homies hate covid Fuck off, Covid In true British fashion, to the tune of Come On, Eileen. I bet we're going to be hearing this in crowds along with trumpets to those same three notes as \"come on England!\" Fuck you, Covid It\u2019s time to get out of The UK, Covid What were you even doing there in the first place, Covid? You didn\u2019t even get everyone infected, Covid Are you happy now, Covid? Fuck you, Covid. All the scientists, researchers, volunteers, and all the behind the scenes workers who have worked so hard to get this vaccine (and all the others) to this point deserve some kind of award. I\u2019d be surprised and simultaneously unsurprised if they don\u2019t win the Nobel in physiology and medicine at least Everyone's done their part. Thank you for this comment. Reddit gold? Clapping begins at 8 everyone! About time, I hope the Oxford one also turns out to be as effective, as it can be stored and transported safely in developing countries unlike the Pfizer one Just for comparison, going to throw in here that the flu vaccine is about 59% effective in adults 18-65. The Oxford one is 5% less effective and it is hoped it'll be approved by the end of the year. One point of clarification is that the Pfizer vaccine can likely also be transported at 5C as it is using the same delivery system. Pfizer simply didn\u2019t do a temperature study like Oxford so they can\u2019t officially claim that. About time? Never before was a medical application developed this quickly before. Usually it takes about 10 years and costs 2 billion dollars to get medicine on the market. One year is insanly fast! This is amazing. How is this not really big news on Reddit? Americans are asleep at the moment. American here, how big is this news in terms of football fields? On the east coast it is currently 6 am. Give it a couple of hours. People dont like the UK here, can guarantee a bad news story about the UK/Boris would be way more upvoted It is, you just have to give it a bit of time. American here. I just woke up and I am over the fucking moon. This news just instantly brightened my mood, I don't think it will be possible for me to have a bad today. I'm so proud of the virologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, biochemists and of the course the   who chose to put themselves out there for humanity. What a fucking achievement. This is such good news. They've built a centre in my city already that can vaccinate 100k people a week. The government has fucked up so much during this crisis, I really hope I can look back in a few months and say they stuck the landing Credit goes to the scientists and the career civil servants. In the rest of european union, we must wait for the official green light from the EU. Godspeed to UK though. The last words spoken before the zombie outbreak started. They had a great start with the far-more-left-wing-than-anyone-expected 80% furlough scheme. Looks like we're having a great end too, being the first country to approve a vaccine. Shame they fucked up basically everything in the middle. getting a vaccine is gonna be like trying to get an xbox series x or a ps5 lol Scalpers going to sell the vaccine on Facebook marketplace and eBay  /s Pretty much the opposite demographics though. The government have set out what order people will get it in, so if you're a young, healthy person, it's gonna be a while. But that's okay, it's far more important to protect the vulnerable and front line workers. Genuinely curious at how they\u2019re going to roll it out. Getting booked for a test was a nightmare to start and this will be in such a higher demand. Good news regardless! They're gonna be in stacks at the local Target like the consoles were on Saturday? Sweet, though they're gonna have to crank the AC in Target to like -70C I guess. Let\u2019s get this vaccine train rollin. I know it\u2019ll take some time to roll out, but I\u2019m hype. We\u2019re on our way back to normalcy boys! Hats off to everyone involved in making this vaccine happen in record time. I\u2019m curious to see how quickly/efficiently the U.K. will roll this out to the public. Hopefully we hear an approval from the U.S. and EU in the coming weeks/days. This is definitely a step in the right direction. The U.K. has really impressive logistics and I\u2019m sure they are going to get the army and basically everyone involved in the process, today they said they are going to create vaccination centres in the nightingales model and this will be alongside a community model in which the vaccine that does not need to be stored at -70c will be used in local gps! The relief our healthcare systems will get just by vaccinating our healthcare workers is good news. Right now they have to work under unbelievable stress. Know of two people (healthcare workers) confirmed to be getting it next week. The hospitals started planning at least a week earlier, hopefully more. Hopefully it's quick and much more successful than anything else the government has tried to do this year! EU decision is due on 29 Dec for the Pfizer vaccine and 12 Jan for the Moderna one. It was posted but not really upvoted, so posting it here to provide that information to people who hadn't seen it. I'm really worried about all the anti-vaxxers, they're all over youtube comment sections, news articles and facebook, full of conspiracy theories. Really hope it's not going to pose an issue and this is just a vocal minority. Well if it\u2019s anything like my flu vaccine at the weekend, pretty impressive. Everyone had to be masked and stay 2m apart. You were then given a 1 minute slot, which you had to be on time for with your arm out ready to go. There were two nurses vaccinating. I\u2019ve not seen it done like that ever here. Ramp the amount of people up doing the vaccinations, you could do a lot of people quite quickly. I believe the FT (who called this approval about a week ago) are saying the EU won't approve until end of the month. I am SO ready to go and stand awkwardly in bars again! I\u2019ll have this shot as soon as I can, I\u2019m not in a severe at risk group but am close to those who are. i have been immuno suppressed due to medication and that ends soon. the condition was respiratory and covid would definitely have finished me off 4 weeks ago. i can't wait for the opportunity to get this and the gp says i will be in the first tranche when it's available to her woot! Yeah if you're not an NHS worker or an old/vulnerable person, you're going to be waiting a long time. Not fussed when I get it, I just want my grandmother to get it so myself and family can visit her again Doesn't this vaccine only protect you from the affects, not make you not infectious? It's multiple shots Unless you're in a high priority group you're more likely to end up with the AstraZeneca Vaccine when it rolls around - its much cheaper and easier to distribute. It will be the more common vaccine once it's hit the market. Me too. When I went to get a vaccine booster the other day the pharmacist said probably March for us normal folk. And TBH I'm fine with that, it was way sooner than most of the doomsayers were saying we'd get one. Get it to people who need it most, first. I can keep waiting/taking precautions as long as I can get the vaccine sooner rather than later. How long does the vaccine last, does everyone have to get it every year? They're hoping for multiple years worth of immunity, but there's no way to be sure, considering it's been less than a year since they even started the vaccine. I think the idea might be that if enough people get it we achieve herd immunity, and maybe the virus will have nowhere to go, reducing the need for followup vaccines. This may be wrong tho, I'm no expert, so feel free to correct me. Finally, an end in sight The light of the tunnel is slowly but surely coming. For first world countries. My friend is a care worker in the UK, so excited for her to get it! My mum is, so I share this sentiment. Not to mention that she literally cannot afford to live if she has to take time off work if she gets the virus. In addition, she is not protected whatsoever from it as she works in a care home who do not take the virus seriously enough from the sounds of it. Yeah, I have several care worker family members, one of whom hasn't been able to work as she's also in a high risk group, so I'm very happy they'll be able to get it soon. As a care worker in the UK also, thank you for thinking of us \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m very happy for our friends in the UK! The end is finally coming into sight. Delivery and usage starts within a week! Great news to wake up to. I'd take this tomorrow if I could For people who are worried that this vaccine was made \"too fast\": We are used to vaccine development taking decades because that's what we saw in our lifetimes. But the early vaccines were so easy that physicians in the 1800's who didn't really know what viruses were could develop a rudimentary vaccine within a few months of work. Vaccine research for existing diseases is only slow because the easy problems got solved centuries ago, we are stuck with the hardest nuts to crack. Covid is a brand-new virus, it could have been as easy as rabies or as hard as HIV, I think we simply got lucky. If it was more like SARS1, we might still be stuck on the animal research phase. Historically, infectious disease vaccines that reach Phase 3 trials have an 85% probability of success (source :  ) . It normally takes years for the trials to pass because volunteers generally get infected at a fixed rate. Covid was spreading so rapidly that this process was greatly accelerated. The trials were not rushed, the evidence of was just generated at an extremely fast pace. The trials were not rushed, the evidence of was just generated at an extremely fast pace. This isn't fully accurate. The trials were absolutely shortened. That's why they're applying for emergency authorization with the various regulatory bodies. I'm not saying it's a concern, just pointing out that the results from the trials are preliminary analysis. The trials are on-going and aren't completed. They'll continue to track those involved and record data. I'm absolutely not anti-vax, but the thing I don't get is how it is possible to study long term side effects of a drug that hasn't been through a long term trial. I don't doubt the effectiveness of the cure, I'm mostly concerned about the above. I also don't know how it's usually done, but I'm sceptical about there not having been taken any shortcuts at all. I remember a friend who works in medicine saying that usually the delay with most vaccine trials is bureaucratic paperwork. And since the covid vaccine is desperately needed, that paperwork was mostly eliminated so it could be fast-tracked. I get people concerned about the risk of long-term effects, but I'd rather take a very small gamble on unlikely long-term effects of this vaccine vs. well-documented and proven long-term effects of covid.  is shitting themselves Covid was a new world order ploy to get everyone to give up their rights to the government. Next comes microchips via vaccine. You'll get a card with your vaccine that you'll have to show to enter stores or travel. Soon you'll all be forced into labor camps to work for the new world order. I look forward to Scott Hall and Kevin Nash being our new leaders, but I'm not so sure about Hollywood Hulk Hogan. A jab   a National ID card, they must be going insane! To the good people of the UK, I hope you guys get over this pandemic as fast as possible. I wish you all well and I hope you start seeing less numbers by febuary. Meanwhile I gotta enjoy that operation warp speed being slower than the UK lol. What a joke my country is right now. Glad to see kind messages from people instead of the usual Reddit hostility! I hope this works and I hope our Oxford vaccine works so we can share it with the world, including developing countries because it doesn't need to be frozen. We're set to approve it on the 12th I believe. Great news. I\u2019ve always been amazed by medical workers, people who spend each day helping others and seeing countless horrible and heartbreaking things, and this pandemic really has cemented in my mind just how brave and selfless these front-line workers are. I\u2019m very happy that soon they will be able to work without the fear of contracting COVID, and hopefully now be able to look forward to the end of this pandemic. How much of the population has to be vaccinated for it to kill off COVID? They\u2019re saying 70% should do it. Just out of curiosity because I\u2019m not entirely sure, is there a chance of long term side effects being undiscovered due to how quickly it\u2019s been produced? I\u2019m not entirely sure how the process works and wanted to know if it was something to worried or not. If not inject it into my vainssss Can't study long term effects of Corona either, but one seems better than the other Like a guy above said and i quote \"High effectiveness and since it's an mRNA vaccine it's much safer than traditional vaccines. You don't get the dangerous parts of the virus injected only the spike protein which is harmless. Also everything you get injected is gone after a few weeks so there is basically no risk of negative long-term effects.\" I'd also like to know this! I'm not against vaccines at all, I've just heard stories about vaccines in the past having long-term side affects and am worried it could be the same case here. Would appreciate any knowledge anyone has to share. I'm not completely on board because I still remember the Pandemrix vaccine. Gonna end up with a COVID vaccine before I get my RTX 3080. As someone from the UK I'm so happy. I think the govt knew how much we needed this which is how it's got done and dusted so early, because there are so many people not taking the rules seriously. I've already had Covid and had very light symptoms (as a young healthy person) but my father in his 80's will be getting this, he is still teaching piano at home and living mostly by himself so things have been very hard for him. And me making sure I don't give it to him. The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years This is such a huge achievement in Human History .. hopefully, everything goes well, and we get our normal life back soon What people need to realise when they see timeframe is that most vaccines take so long because of funding application and processing paperwork etc. It'll be really interesting to see how Reddit reacts to this. The demographic tends to be a younger pro vaccine audience but at the same time anti UK due to its colonial past. Some big mixed responses coming I think. I've already seen other posts on this immediately bring up Scotland which is crazy and nothing to do with this but that's Reddit for you. It's an amazing achievement of the UK regulatory, scientific, and educational bodies. Honestly if you'd told me we'd have a vaccine by December I'd not have believed it. No one should fall for the loud minority either. The UK has a low number of anti vaxxers and is massively a progressive, science based culture that cares for the vulnerable. The priority list that has been released shows that the most vulnerable will get this vaccine first. I'm proud of my country and its achievements today despite many other areas for criticism that absolutely do exist. The UK is still world class in many areas and while I didn't vote Brexit and hate that we're leaving the EU I still have high hopes that Britain will continue to be an inclusive society where we welcome people from across the world. Those same people from all over the world that were involved in this vaccine, our Oxford vaccine, and our healthcare system. It'll be interesting to see the widespread impact of this whether it speeds up approval elsewhere, or will countries wait and see it's effect on the Brits. The US will be approving this in December, the EU will approve it by Jan. Absolutely incredible achievement. Just out of interest, what happens to the mRNA in the cells? Does it simply breakdown when the cell is destroyed by the immune system or can it replicate itself? It's broken down shortly after it's translated, mRNA is not a very stable molecule. Wooo the beginning of the end Science saves our ungrateful asses. Again. I will not be getting this vaccine until it's been out and used for a while... Largely because I'm not in the age range or occupation to get it. In fact those are the only reasons. Beware the fucking idiot conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers in the comments. This is a great win for all of humanity and we made history. Some people have been watching way to much TV... Kudos to the UK for authorizing it this quickly. Boy am I   looking forward to anti-vaxxer nitwits shitting things up everywhere, though. And I'm sitting here watching AWS Re:invent 2020 videos and, presuming he's being accurate, the guy speaking now says Moderna, another vaccine manufacturer, used machine learning and rapid expansion of compute resources. I welcome anti-vaxxer nitwits. One less person in the queue for a vaccine and sane people can get on with business in semi-normality. Take me back to the motherland please \ud83d\ude28 I hope my mom can get it when it comes to the US. :( My 2 shares I bought of Pfizer and moderna should be making me a millionaire any day now \ud83d\ude02 So my company just announced they will begin giving vaccines to front line workers first. I work for a major hospital corporation. I agree with this, that ER and intensive care units get them first, however I work in xray and we are ALL over the hospital, including the ER. We are as much front line as the er and icu in the sense that we are always in there doing xrays. However we are not included in the first rounds, and have to wait til everyone else gets them. It's typical though, xray always gets the last of things.. Whoa, that\u2019s pretty crazy news. Awesome! Who knows if the public is willing to take the vaccine. There are so many conspiracies spreading and anti-vaccinations are at its high. Good luck UK! Alfie from Wolverhampton with a btec in PE - \u201cNah it ain\u2019t possible m8, never takin that vaccine m8.\u201d I'm looking forward to the 28 days after the start of the vaccination Proud moment to be British, the NHS workers desperately deserve this. Also sounds like they'll be receiving it along with the elderly as early as possible. Yep elderly and care home workers first then NHS workers Great news, I am ready to become Blinky and see the world again. People, as good as this is, remember that actual mass roll out will take months, because of production and distribution bottlenecks! Stay safe!! I have so many questions but since this post has been up for a while I doubt anyone will see it. Why are two shots a month apart required? How much of an impact will this be if people only get the first shot? I know that they said they could have 1.3 billion vaccines produced by the end of next year so worldwide ~650 million will be vaccinated. I know that other companies are producing vaccines so that number will definitely go up but how long will it take for there to be a noticeable impact? I worry is that people will see that the vaccine is going to be rolling out soon and let their guard down. My biggest concern is how the hospitals will hold up over the next couple of months with winter kicking in. I\u2019m not trying to be a downer or take away from the hope this brings. I just hope people understand that they still need to take covid seriously for now while they celebrate this great news. 1: to build both short & long-term immune cells, according to the Biontech  CEO. Lots of ordinary vaccinations require booster shots too, after all. It's not unusual. 2:  They'll likely only build short-term immunity, the kind that fades in 90-120 days. When Biontech publishes the data soon, there'll likely be more in-depth info on this. 3: The CEO estimates 9-12 months before we can abandon our masks.  Happy vaccine day everyone! well, whatever happened to that Astrazeneca-oxford vaccine? I hope they dont stop with that, rest of the developing world is kind of counting on that vaccine. I feel like this is going to create an economic vaccine class system, where rich countries get the pfizer/moderna vaccine and everyone else gets the azn-oxford vaccine We\u2019re in the endgame now. I am by no means anti-vax, and have had many vaccines in my life, but isn't it kinda spooky taking a vaccine that hasn't been tested for very long at all, relative to every other vaccine? Generally the rapid development has been due to: existing technologies to build on. understanding other coronavirus mechanism of action. Basically running phase I, II and III concurrently. As opposed to 2 years of each, sequentially. Low financial risk of advancing through trials due to extreme demand. Isn't a new flu vaccine developed every year? People seem fine taking that. What's the difference? Good on ya. Lots of bots in here Do u know because u are one? Imagine if this constitutes a return to normalcy, God I never imagined I would be missing 2019 why wouldnt it Unfortunately in the US, when the vaccine becomes readily available we can expect up to half the country to not get the vaccine based on their conspiracies. Might be a stupid question but has it been proven this is safe long term? Feels awfully rushed It feels rushed because researchers usually have to wait for funding, approval etc. which is  what takes up the time. In this case, funding was almost immediately available and everyone placed the research as highest priority. It\u2019s the bureaucracy and begging for funding that\u2019s been rushed, not the testing and trialling. This vaccine is dramatically different to any vaccine in the past, because it\u2019s been the top of every single priority list since February. Even down to the recruiters finding junior level chemical engineers to work in the manufacturing plants (I interviewed for some of those roles - the whole process from getting a call from a recruiter to feedback from the interview saying I didn\u2019t get the job was under two weeks) If it\u2019s approved, it\u2019s approved. Every person that\u2019s involved with approving this is very well aware of those concerns, and know it\u2019s many thousands of lives on the line if they get it wrong. As they\u2019re the scientists, I\u2019ll trust them to know more about it than me Not trying to be pessimistic and am the furthest thing from an anti vaxxer, but I\u2019m holding off for a couple of months. The quickest vaccine in human history, with limited tests as well as any long term effects that may not be known yet. I\u2019d rather stay socially distanced and keep a mask on for a few more months, then get the shot. Most countries will be rolling out the vaccine to frontline medical workers and the elderly in the 1st instance. Unless you are in those groups you will probably have to wait a few months regardless. Unless you're in one of the risk groups you won't be asked to have one probably until next summer anyway. Replace months with years. You need a herd immunity. The only way to get it is vaccinate the herd. Someone has to GP, thank you UK! I am so happy. The end is in sight. Britain has pre-ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, which was 95% effective in a late stage clinical trial. THANK FUCKING GOD Cries in American America will have it within a few weeks. They can\u2019t afford not to. Fascinating.  I\u2019m not sure how it is in the UK within the United States there seems to be this perception that as soon as anybody starts getting the vaccine everything\u2018s going to go back to \u201cnormal\u201c. People don\u2019t seem to understand that even as average people in the population have access to the vaccine masks, social distancing and closed businesses are still going to be there. The UK does have the advantage of a national social health system, that can be geared up for nationwide inoculation (which it is in the process of doing). The health market in the US is so fractured, and there's no central command system that can be used in emergencies. We haven't burned down nearly enough 5G towers. We've really taken our eye off the ball. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but how good will this actually be long term? From what I\u2019ve heard getting the virus only gives you immunity for a few months at best, so I\u2019m assuming it will be the same for a vaccine? If so do we just have to keep constantly taking this every few months forever? I know it\u2019s kind of similar with the flu vaccine but that\u2019s seasonal, and so far COVID hasn\u2019t showed any signs of being worse at different times of the year. Sorry if this sounds stupid it just seems like even with a vaccine things can\u2019t go back to normal The idea is, that with enough people having immunity across the population that it can get down it\u2019ll effectively become no longer in wide circulation and to the eventual goal of eradication (yay!). Also with a vaccine you usually get a booster jab that extends the immunity so your white blood cells can store the \u2018code\u2019 to respond to another infection in future :) From what I\u2019ve heard getting the virus only gives you immunity for a few months at best, so I\u2019m assuming it will be the same for a vaccine? I think that is not clear. As far as I heard, it is not fully understood why the immunity might not last that long, and it is very well possible that this class 2 vaccine can circumvent the reasons for that. The body is told in a completly different way to form antibodies, so it is very well possible that it works longterm. Big pharma would never lie for money  if the vaccine will be available in a specific country / region.. will it be mandatory for everyone or will it be free to choose if you want to do it or not (i guess most people want to)? or will it maybe even depend on your job / work you do? how will this be done? i never thought about this whole thing in detail but now i'm curious how this will be likely be done. edit: i'm not anti-vax, just curious about how it will be rolled out likely. I don't think it will be mandatory in most democratic countries. I can imagine it being mandatory for certain occupations such as healthcare. So, I can\u2019t answer for everywhere, but in my country you cannot be forced to take the vaccine. If you are a hospital worker, maybe. IIRC I did however hear that since some of the vaccines have a 95% efficiency you only need like 3/4 of the population to vaccinate to reach herd immunity - a lot of older adults are very skeptical after the whole swine flu vaccine thing, where some of the recipients developed things like epilepsy. I didn't think i'd get so emotional at the news, my nan has COPD and more than anything im so happy for her, she will finally get some normalcy back after an horrific year. Well done to the scientists and those volunteers willing to put their bodies on the line for testing. I know we're running out of time, with the global economy collapsing due to covid and corners are inevitably going to be cut, but I really hope this vaccine has no adverse effects. That being said, I'll still get it as soon as I can. It appears that the only adverse effects are things like headaches, fever, general aches, and fatigue that last around 2 days. Outside of that, there has been little report of anything extraordinarily bad. That being said, I\u2019d take that 3 times over instead of COVID. give me all of the vaccines right now This is great! Hopefully the US follows suit. Also, I'm assuming this means Pfizer and BioNTech stock will be rising come morning? Time to finish my vaccination course, business is boomin This day is history. Vaccination will take a while, I see that they'll likely only get the vaccine rolled out to everyone by end of spring / early summer, optimistically. What are the risks of someone who is vaccinated acting like they are totally immune? Can they still spread it? Increased chance of mutations? This is the light at the end of the tunnel. Talk is cheap but when approvals are done, it's a bit of a relief after months of never knowing. WOOHOO!!!! fuck yessss Humans ... We get shit done ! I hope enough have been rolled out and used before christmas, not for me though (I'm happy to have an excuse not to leave my house) but for the morons who are stupid enough to travel without a vaccine but not quite stupid enough to be anti vax Let's goooo bois!!! i can't wait to get back into theaters and concerts I sat in a lecture with the chief pharmacist of the Sussex NHS trust, they believe they will have vulnerable groups vaccinated by March, which is excellent news. Fuck yeah !! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f I'm so proud of that happening this fast in the UK! This vaccine hopefully will help on reducing the virus greatly over there! stick it in me So I am uneducated on this subject. Why is the UK getting the vaccine first as opposed to the US or other European countries? FDA is setting for emergency review I believe on the 7th of December. If approved then roll out to USA This should be top of front page. Do people only upvote bad news? Did they said who will be vaccinated first?some news say frontline workers, others high risk groups care home residents and their carers are first on the list Great news! Lets just hope there's nothing in the near future which may slow down imports or cause issues at our ports... ...oh shit. BRB moving to uk Trump will blow a fuse, because \"he\" is not 1st to confirm. Saved by the Germans. Remind me in 28 days..... In all seriousness though this is awesome can't any nation produce their own vaccine now by just copying the formula of phizer? Faster. Excellent vaccine ", "Trending"], "Topic": "Trending"},

Keep in mind that this is brand new server so activity levels will be low to start, but the goal here is to have a moderately active server soon, and what better time to start than when we have nothing else to do since many of our favorite sports are on hiatus! So come hang out and talk about just about anything (SFW only) with other sports fans, both hardcore and casual. We appreciate any members that decide to join and hope you have fun! Looking forward to meeting you all there! Be sure to read over the server rules when you join, as they differ slightly from our subreddit rules. Joined, this place seems pretty cool so far Honestly Glad being here,. Would be very interested in NBA, ATHLETICS. TENNIS, FOOTBALL. What\u2019s the point of this sub then if you want us to all move to discord? Honestly I think it just brings confusion. It\u2019s just an extension of the sub. We\u2019d use the reddit built in chat room feature if it weren\u2019t trash. Great playground for sports lovers How do I join the discord? Ignore this just testing my flair change Hey Hope it's nice and worth it Note to self: join reddit sports discord server in the morning Did you do it? Hi ", "Sports"], "Topic": "Sports"},
{"Mick Schumacher to race for Haas in 2021 as famous surname returns to the F1 grid.": ["We created a Discord server for our community and would like to invite all of you to join! You'll be able to discuss sports with users around the world and discuss events in real time! There are separate channels for many sports you can opt in and out of, including; American Football, Soccer, Baseball, Basketball, Aussie Rules Football, Rugby Union and League, Cricket, Motorsports, Fitness, and many more. I hope as fans we can let him grow into the sport and not just put him on an immediate pedestal that he feels he needs to live up to because of the reputation that his name brings. He's still going to be an F1 rookie and he's still human. And he's at Haas. Results will be delayed, to put it mildly. To put it less mildly, he'll be lucky if his brakes fail only once next season I have witnessed the hype Mick already was in his F3 days. No, they will hype it up in F1 even more. Villeneuve didn\u2019t take long I think that\u2019s what happened with Sebastian Vettel. People wanted a Schumacher 2.0. I hope as fans we can let him grow into the sport and not just put him on an immediate pedestal You must be new here. Seeing his name on a Haas car is going to do plenty to temper expectations. Next year will mostly be a test to see if the problem was the drivers or if it was management. Same.  I am concerned they are promoting him up for ratings and $ due to the attraction of his name.  He has had a couple good years in F2 and F3.  Just hope it is not too soon for the driving and the pressure. Ahhh. To go back to a time when we could all be just human Verstappen, another second generation f1 driver, won his inaugural race and has become one of the most formidable drivers in the field in a very short time. I feel like the grid is near half made up of famous surnames nowadays In 2001, we had Verstappen, Schumacher, Raikkonen and Alonso on the grid. Next year we have Verstappen, Schumacher, Raikkonen and Alonso on the grid. Verstappen is the son of a former F1 driver. Same as Mick. And then Sainz is the son of a famous rally driver. It's getting hereditary. Yeah because the sport is so hard to get into. The main reason Albon drives under the Thai flag instead of the British is because his Thai sponsors are the only reason he's an F1 driver at all. You need money and connections from a young age to be an F1 driver, it's no wonder F1 kids: I want to be an artist F1 Parents: You will learn the family trade and that is final!! Seen Lauda\u2019s kid and Senna\u2019s nephew run the circuits in IMSA a couple years ago. no kidding Real shame he\u2019s gotta drive for haas tho.  That teams been a dumpster fire the past couple seasons But you never know with F1. Last year Racing Point finished 7th in the constructor championship and was considered a mid-field team at best. Then this year they are consistently getting points and even managed to get two podiums, almost three if Checo's car hadn't blow up in the final laps of Bahrain. Maybe Haas manages to build an amazing car out of the blue for 2021. That teams been a dumpster fire Very much so! I know that would make his dad proud. Just checked his progress and it made me tear up. So many years living so dangerously and the furthest thing from ones\u2019 imagination happens. Young Schumacher has some shoes to fill, and I bet he will come close at a minimum. No pressure or anything. Lots of drivers have looked competitive in the lower formulas, and then gone on to do very little in F1. Frentzen and Schumacher Sr were rivals in lower formula with many considering Frentzen to be the quicker driver. Look what happened when they both got to F1. You need a lot of things to fall into place to become F1 champion. He\u2019ll have a lot of pressure because he\u2019s expected to deliver. He\u2019ll have to handle that. Just read up on his dad's progress. Jeez, he is still making progress 7 years after his accident. Hope he continues to improve. Please enlighten me: what has happened with Michael Schumacher? Did he wake up from the coma? Is still in it? As best as I can tell he is not in a coma anymore....several people have said they have spoke with him....however his condition is always described as being very delicate (paraphrasing)....which leads me to believe that he is probably not ambulatory and not very responsive unfortunately (but that\u2019s just my opinion) The family is very secretive about it. And he made no public appearances since the accident. I guess he is in some kind of vegetative state. Meanwhile Perez ( Top 5 pilot imo) will have no team next year. Didn't think that was settled yet. Still possible he could slot in at RedBull Top 5 pilot imo No he is not lol He was in beast mode in Bahrain, was fun to watch. He could still go to RB. With a complete human garbage of a team mate. Lets not jump to conclusions. Yes things that are out there about him dont make look too great, but maybe f1 will make him mature since he will be among the best of the best. Whats wrong with Nikita Mazepin? i dont know much about him. I've been so behind F1 for too many years now, I thought this is the older Schumacher and wondered for a few seconds, how Michael did not age a day. Thankfully I read the article. But really, how does Michael have a 21 y.o. son already? Update: just checked, he's now 51! How time flies. Netflix has a great series on the 2018 and 2019 seasons if you want to catch up Unfortunately he had a terrible accident a few years ago while skiing and suffered a horrible neurological injury. He likely doesn\u2019t know Mick will be racing in F1 or can\u2019t comprehend. Terrible terrible. Haas is the Cleveland Browns of F1. Change my mind. The Browns are actually doing well this season. They're going to be shit for 20 years then start winning? Hmm, yes. Thats some big shoes to fill! Uncle Ralf set quite the benchmark Lol, I love everybody complaining about nepotism  having no idea that Mick is a former F3 Champion and is leading the F2 Championship. Plenty of undeserving drivers have been given seats, but Mick is not one of them. Of course his family name and money probably helped along the way, but that shouldn\u2019t count against his success What ever happened to Ralf.. His thumbs look so weird in that picture and I can\u2019t get over it I alway has a driver who last name is Schumacher! Netflix drive to survive gonna be thicc with drama despite not having many race to follow Any idea when the next season comes out? It\u2019s happening! wtf is happening with his dad? havent heard any news in years i think the family is super private about affairs. Probably a vegetable or severely incapacitated.  It's been many years since the accident and they have not let even a picture of him come out, or at least that I'm aware of. Totally outrageous that Perez has no seat, but this guy gets to race.  He\u2019s not the famous Schumacher. love it. hate that he has to team up with that entitled douche. keep laughing today thinking about yoda nutting for the first time in 500 years and immediately he starts talking regular again I follow F1 somewhat, but I don't follow the upcoming drivers, anyone who follows, how much of this is deserved and how much of it is because his last name is schumacher? Let's take up a pool, how many races till Lando slams into him? Did Michael ever recover from his ski accident?  Is he still alive? Ngl....I read that as Michael Schumacher to return to F1 and nearly jumped off my chair. Thought I was dreaming. I hope Mick gets all the success he deserves :) Maybe they can come fix our multiple Haas CNC drills that have been down for two weeks FAST. Hope he is nicer to the sport than his dad was. Explain I\u2019m new to f1 He's winning f2 this year, so it's not like he's there just because of who his father is You mean Damon Hill the son of Graham Hill? Even Lewis Hamilton\u2019s half brother is racing in BTCC. However he never seems to finish a race. I must say Nicholas Hamilton does have cerebral palsy. I think it\u2019s wonderful to have someone with such disability compete in motorsport. I just can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s only because of his famous name that he has been given the opportunity. That was several years ago. Bruno Senna raced from 2010-2012, but he never drove for a particularly good team. He\u2019s now having some success in the World Endurance Championship Edit: I was reminded that he did in fact score points, mostly in the Williams in 2012 Anyone ever notice in 'The Expanse' Alex, the pilot, calls Holden \"Haas\" several times. Is this the source of the expression? Hoss is a slang word for horse. Basically calling the person big, strong, and dependable. He's leading the F2 championship. The soccer fandom is leaking Nepotism doesn't explain away an F3 championship and a current lead in the F2 championship. Both are spec series, so driver skill shines through way more. Yes being the son of one of the greatest drivers of all time gave him opportunities, but opportunities don't mean shit without talent and hard work, especially given modern super license requirements Mick Schumacher is literally leading F2. Out of junior drivers he is literally the best. He's leading the f2 championships which is a feeder to f1. Yes he's had the advantage of being born to a successful father, but he's actually a very good driver. Yes, it\u2019s true that having that surname will bring sponsors and contacts, but the guy is good. Same thing happened with Verstappen, he\u2019s the son of a F1 driver, but he\u2019s probably the best/2nd best driver in the grid. If your father is short, has good reflexes and amazing hand eye coordination, you probably will have that too. If you add this to his experience helping you grow as a driver, you can see that this is a great advantage. Is F1 not a sport? Go for a lap in one of those beasts and then come back and tell us if it\u2019s a sport... your neck will fall off after the first turn. ", "Sports"], "Topic": "Sports"},
{"Megathread: Attorney General Barr: No Widespread Election Fraud": ["Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. His comments come despite President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claims that the election was stolen, and his refusal to concede his loss to President-Elect Joe Biden. In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr said U.S. Attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they\u2019ve received, but they\u2019ve uncovered no evidence that would change the outcome of the election. Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis say this: \"With all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation.\" Dropping their allies quicker than hair dye on a gremlin face. I love that Trump is going out with this long, excruciating whimper instead of a bang. Not with a bang but with a WI/MI/PA On Parler, Bill Mitchell calls Bill Barr \u201ca deep state snake and Bush plant.\u201d These people are completely insane. It tracks though, the fight has now shifted against long time establishment Republicans. It's Trump's final consolidation of power, to officially turn it into his party. Why does Trump keep hiring Deep State people who a fighting against him?  Amazing isn't it. On Parler LOL If anyone was actually part of an illegal shadow government meant to subvert democracy, it was Bill Barr. Right for the wrong reasons? Kaitlan Collins from CNN is on Twitter about this.. After telling the Associated Press there is no evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of the election, Attorney General Bill Barr just arrived at the White House Then Wow. Rudy Giuliani & Jenna Ellis going after Barr, saying \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation...Again, with the greatest respect to the Attorney General, his opinion appears to be without any knowledge or investigation.\u201d Edit: except he did have prosecutors looking at it. Article a couple weeks old.. Prosecutors assigned to investigate baseless allegations of irregularities in vote tallies told Attorney General William Barr that they found no \"substantial irregularities,\"\u00a0 The AP article that broke this story also specifically says that the FBI has been, and continues to investigate the allegations of fraud: Barr said U.S. attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they\u2019ve received, but they\u2019ve uncovered no evidence that would change the outcome of the election. \u201cMost claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations and. And those have been run down; they are being run down,\u201d Barr said. \u201cSome have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.\u201d Apparently there was no meeting scheduled either, he was summoned.  Barr's definitely getting screamed at right now.  Damn Rudy and Jenna are deep in character for the panto. Is it money or blackmail? \"There\u2019s a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don\u2019t like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and \u2018investigate,\u2019\u201d Barr said. Pretty fucking rich coming from the dude who has done exactly that for Trump since the start of his tenure as AG. They're beginning the true transition: making sure the incoming Dems are immediately under fire by criticizing the things the GOP has been doing without shame. \"Increasingly, the tendency...\" means \"when the Dems use the DOJ to prosecute federal crimes we will bring this up.\" Never forget that Bill Barr is a lawless, corrupt hack who politicized the DOJ, and actively tried to suppress democracy in subservience to the most corrupt president this nation has ever seen Bill Barr legitimately believes the President should have absolute authority and freedom from consequences. Fuck Bill Barr. Barr is evil but not stupid. He knows which way the wind is blowing. He has survived many years in the Republican Party... he follows the power not the man. He's going to lose the AG position, and it's not like Trump can do anything else for him now. He was brought in at the tail end of GHWB's presidency to facilitate the pardons and cover-ups. He knows that every minute wasted on Trump's election ranting is a minute that needs to be spent preparing to avoid consequences. Brian Kemp, Dou Docey and now Bill Barr?! ALL DEEP STATE OPERATIVES See Republicans...does your vote even count anymore in a rigged election? Stay home for the runoffs and stick it to the libs! How long before Trump fires him on Twitter? I\u2019m betting before the end of tomorrow night When it shows up on OANN he'll tweet it. Right now it's showing hearings, and he's sitting on his butt watching tv. Edit: a local tv station link:  I guess Barr is a liberal activist antifa plant? In the mob, he's a rat Ha. Like that time Gym Jordan called John Roberts a liberal activist judge in a House committee meeting. I\u2019ve watched so much fucking CSPAN over the last 12 months I can\u2019t remember on what occasion he said it. I\u2019ve popped into   several times lately just to try and get perspective. They really think there\u2019s tons of voter fraud evidence hidden under a mattress somewhere in central PA. It\u2019s an interesting corner of reddit, to say the least. When people are quoting Veritas articles as evidence \ud83d\ude2c According to Jim Acosta, Barr literally arrived at the WH a couple of minutes ago One theory is that Mitch sent him over to have a little chat about Trump shutting up, especially about Georgia. Or Barr's newly revealed special counsel will turn up some evidence about the   origins of the Russia investigations. This just in: Barr recants claim the DOJ and FBI did not identify fraud.  Says a lot of fraud was found but he can\u2019t show us because it\u2019s top secret. All websites: Barr says no election fraud. Fox news website: Barr hasn't found election fraud yet! lol, thought you were joking, but that's their headline \"  to find widespread voter fraud\" Here are the most likely outcomes here. Trump has taken more Xanax then Adderall today. Barr resigns in 72 hours to \"spend more time with his children and grandchildren\". Donald Trump never speaks of him again. Trump has taken more Adderall than Xanax. The insane tweet storm begins at some point between 10pm -2am tonight. Xanax then Adderall Accurate I'll take Insane Tweet Storms for $100, Alex. Also breaking... Barr tries to cover his backside a bit: Attorney General William Barr has given extra protection to the prosecutor he appointed to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, giving him the authority of a special counsel to complete his work without being easily fired. He gave Durham special counsel authority Durham's investigation isn't going to find anything earth shattering and it's likely the new AG will just let it conclude with a whimper. Alternatively, the new AG can just change the scope of the investigation. This move does almost nothing to protect Barr's personal witch hunt. Guess who doesn't want to go to jail like Nixon's AG did... For dumb, gullible rubes who are all deathly terrified of socialism, conservatives sure love getting publicly owned. lol we gonna get AG Giuliani The thought of that makes me vomit a little out my scalp. Now I\u2019m suddenly worried there might have been pro-GOP election fraud. You mean, other than crippling the USPS, shutting down polling locations and giving a wink to right wing extremist groups hell bent on disrupting voters and vote counters for over a week? edit - yes, the fake drop boxes, which the CA(?) GOP admitted to Honestly, it'd give me hope for the US if there was fraud that made it as close as it was. However, listening to my co-workers there wasn't that much. He's saying they found no evidence of fraud because the GOP was committing a lot of fraud, voter suppression and encouraging election day disruption. First the Trump sycophants turned on Fox News when they called Arizona for Biden, calling them \"traitors\". Newsmax has recently been given the same treatment for reporting states certifying their votes for Biden. I have no doubt they'll label Barr the same after this. If your \"metric\" for   is whatever your idol states rather than objective fact, then you're a member of a cult. Really hope they just have to keep boycotting themselves into complete social isolation. Just Trump and what he sends out on Parler. The only safe spaces that will be left after January. lmao now im 100% sure there was pro-gop fraud Lol.  True. I mean they basically disenfranchise people in broad daylight, they just have the power to do it. Its unethical, but unfortunately legal. This is damage control. They\u2019re realizing this whole gambit has backfired in a big fucking way in GA. There\u2019s an outright rebellion brewing in GOP voters because they all think the election is all bullshit. They tried so hard to disenfranchise dem voters that they ended up disenfranchising their own. The definition of stupidity. All that being said, if you live in GA, please for all that is kind and good in this world, vote. Don't assume this stuff means it isn't going to be an incredibly close race. Soros just informed me that since we got to Barr all drinks at cabal holiday parties will be free. Cool cause I saved up all my Soros Bucks for a cool antifa hat! They are NOT HAPPY with Barr on Parler: Parler is officially imploding over Bill Barr. #bushplant \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f They're fucking insane. Can you give me a few more examples.... I\u2019m close ;-@ MSNBC right now is reporting that apparently Hannity said Trump should pardon himself and his whole family. Now, you gotta wonder,  Biased Barr was a low level employee in the Trump administration, and he was not up to the job. That's why I am firing him and replacing him with Rudy. Trump in a tweet, in 15 minutes Looks like the real voter fraud was all the friends we made along the way. R/conservative already crying about brigading and libs coming to rub it in so mods insta flaired the post lol. For people laughing at the left and libs for being snowflakes, they really love being in their safe space and holding each other's hands over reality hitting them. Can't wait for the right to fully disown him. Boy anyone know who \u201cRemoved By Moderator\u201d is? He sure is posting a lot in the conservative threads the trump legal team is mad Barr can't back them up \ud83d\ude02\ud83c\udf7f Just in: A hopeful Rudy Giuliani, who thinks he might become Acting AG if Bill Barr is fired, is currently experiencing chafing after spending the last few hours \"adjusting his microphone.\" Two conservatives died and went to Heaven. They were greeted by God at the pearly gates. Seeking truth, one of the conservatives asked God, \u201cGod, we must know... Was there fraud during the 2020 U.S. presidential election?\u201d God said to the man, \u201cNo, the election was fair and Joe Biden won by a landslide.\u201d The conservative then turned to his friend and said, \u201cWow... the deep-state goes much higher than we thought.\u201d In future news: Attorney General William Barr fired. What a creative way to announce your resignation. Even Barr can\u2019t back up this batshit crazy conspiracy theory. Lol Is this the kraken or Hear me out guys, this is actually genius. First lose all your court cases, next prove no voter fraud by either federal or state investigation....then badda-bing badda-boom Trump is President for life. Q told me. -  probably It will truly be a blessed day when I never have to care about any of these abominable fascist dipshits ever again unless they're being charged with felonies and imprisoned. For those who missed it under the statement, Barr also placed Durham in charge of a Special Counsel investigation into the Mueller Report's origins today.  This guarantees that there will be a (GOP/Barr DOJ) SC investigation much like Mueller's running during Biden's term. Barr is still a massive conniving GOP animal. Firing in 3... 2... He was summoned to the WH 30min ago You know you're fucked when you've lost the support of Bill Barr. They tried so hard They went so far In the end It didn't even matter I like how Trump supporters are acting like Barr is some part of a deeper conspiracy. It can't be that Trump is full of shit and is only crying \"voter fraud\" because that's what he does literally any time he loses an election (like when Cruz beat him in Iowa in 2016 or when he lost the popular vote in 2016), literally everyone is conspiring against Trump. Dude is a giant man-baby incapable of handling losing, and you're a bunch of chums for believing him over literally everyone else saying \"yeah, he's full of shit\". Edit: and if you want receipts for that claim about Trump's fraud claims, here you go: Lmao will conservatives now turn on Barr and call him a deep state communist, Marxist, socialist, Democrat? He's literally Trump's right hand man. This is how the Trump ends. Not with a bang, but a shitload of impotent whining. Oh no. Anyway.. I was told there would be Krakens unleashed and things would get Biblical... I texted my dad this. His response? \"Think with your ears, not with your eyes\" No wonder Republicans are so confused. We think with our brains Your dad is in a cult. What the fuck does that even mean? Lol R/Conservative really be saying that Barr has always worked against Trump LOL Joe Biden is president elect \ud83d\ude0e This is actually funny as fuck lmao Wow. The deep-state even got to Barr! /s Incoming \u201cBill Barr is the worst AG in the history of the world\u201d tweet Conservatives already disowning him on Parler this is hilarious THAT'S IT! I'm definitely boycotting the Georgia run-offs now. Us conservatives need to stick together and support Trump no matter what. You guys with me? I fully support you in this decision 100% write trump in and own a lib! He is going to be fired Friday and the fascist lawyer Joe DiGenova will take his place.. And the thread for this on   has already been removed.  Sad. Edit:   Hey, they need their safe spaces. What\u2019s funny is, now when people cry voter fraud, you can literally point a finger and say \u201cTrump\u2019s own Attorney General found no evidence of fraud\u201d and it still won\u2019t matter to them. Guys he has a blue mask!! Blue = Democratic = Socialist = Communist Coincidence? I think not!! gradually watching another repub turn their back on Trump daily is just.... I can only get so erect.. \"I never liked Barr. I barely knew him. I didn't even hire him.\" -- Donald Trump probably I hopped on FOX News' YouTube channel and saw that the Right is now calling Barr a Democrat-plant. You can't make this shit up Sidney Powell has just offered an affidavit from Ron Watkins -   - as evidence in her Georgia lawsuit. Watching conservatives turn on Barr is going to be so glorious to watch \"You can't tell me there is no fraud when I'm watching it live on OAN with my own eyes!\" God my part of the country is the fucking worst.  everybody... Fraud does not equal impropriety. Sometimes it\u2019s not about what is said but what is not said. Rats fleeing a sinking ship there will be no evidence of him having a job soon I mean at this point he is part of the swamp... Always was Liar Lou Dobbs absolutely loses it over Bill Barr saying there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud, accusing Barr of joining \"the Deep State and the Resistance\" before saying this: \"He is either a liar or a fool or both. He may be \u2013 perhaps compromised.\" Lol they're nuts! He didn\u2019t watch that one video I saw on YouTube. I\u2019ll try to find it but it proves deep state soros commie chavez voter fraud. They're trying to get people back in line in Georgia. Nothing more. After the election Barr will probably start it up again, but from his living room. Rudy is   at the thought of being the next AG In other news, President Trump announces on Twitter that Attorney General William Barr is fired. Later today: I NEVER LIKED DEEP STATE NEVER TRUMPER BILLY BUMBLARR So Barr was part of the deep state all along?! /s (sadly, necessary) AG Barr jumping from a sinking ship.. how predictable. It's funny that you could scarcely imagine a more craven republican bootlicker than Barr, who defended Trump at almost every turn and even gassed protestors in Washington for Trump's bible photo-op, and deployed federal agents to protestors in portland and other cities. Yet even Barr is somehow disloyal now... these people are truly pathetic Trump\u2019s assertions are   based in rigorous facts and a value for truth. Rather, they are based on feelings and his value of himself. If something is perceived by Trump to be personally beneficial, he will infamously exclaim it is the greatest thing to ever happen in the world. Conversely, If something is felt by Trump to be personally threatening, then he will relentlessly attack it as fake, a fraud, or rigged. When running for the Republican Party nominee in 2016, Trump rejected the results of the Iowa caucuses, asserting based on no evidence whatsoever: \u201cTed Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!...Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.\u201d Before the 2016 general election, polls estimated Trump had about a 30% chance of beating Clinton. So he again, without any evidence, relentlessly exclaimed that \u201cThis election is absolutely being rigged\u2026\u201d In 2016, Trump indeed lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly three million votes. Yet he won the Electoral College. But he used the platform of the Presidency to attack: \u201cIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" Trump has repeatedly stated and implied that three to five million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. In 2017, Trump instigated after the fact the creation of a Voter Fraud investigation to discover evidence supporting his claims. Because he did not have any evidence supporting his claims when he made them. He merely felt election fraud was true. The opposite proposition, that he was unpopular, was threatening. Eight months later this investigation was quietly shut down without remotely justifying Trump\u2019s wild conspiracy theories of election fraud. In 2020, with the country fighting the Covid-19 epidemic, States began preparing for the election. There existed broad anticipation for large numbers of mail-in-votes, especially from urban areas badly affected by the virus. So Trump began attacking the USPS, attempting to defund it and cripple its operation while more broadly attacking the election process. \u201cNow [Democrats] need that money in order to have the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots\u2026 If we don\u2019t make a deal that means they don\u2019t get the money. That means they can\u2019t have universal mail in voting. It just can\u2019t happen.\u201d Trump, Fox Business Interview Trump suddenly installed a loyalist donor with no credible experience as Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy DeJoy implemented sweeping changes to USPS operations, firing postal officials, reducing workers hours, and eliminating sorting machines, causing a widespread slowdown of the service. Meanwhile, Trump began falsely campaigning that votes not received and counted by election day were invalid. Trump publicly called for his \u201csupporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully.\u201d This is one of many examples of his unAmerican voter intimidation tactics. Trump publicly demanded the DOJ arrest his opponent, Presidential nominee Joe Biden, based on propaganda sourced back to Rudy Giuliani and Russian disinformation. (It is not yet clear if he also privately asked the AG Willaim Barr to do this.) On election night, far before the votes were counted but just as had been leaked to be his intention weeks prior, Trump declared victory! Despite losing, Trump declared himself the winner of the election; he demanded that votes stop being counted where he was winning and that only Rrepublican votes continue to be counted where he was losing; and he simultaneously celebrated the broad down ballot success of the Republican party while asserting that those very same ballots which equally broadly did not vote for him were fraudulent. This malicious, tin-pot dictator assault on our institution of democracy is unprecedented. And it is perhaps the most fundamentally destabilizing attack against the U.S. since the Confederate rebellion. Neither Pearl Harbor nor 9/11 ever realized the chance of so basically upsetting our society and government. Trump did not have evidence of fraud when he told the world the election was rigged and that he instead won in 2020. And he is tearing the U.S. apart, destroying the   established norm of a peaceful transition of power so to seek the resemblance of any such evidence. All because the election results are a threat to him and his corrupt legal immunity as President. Fuck Trump and Fuck you Trump Supporters. Every single one of y'all are \ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude02 Ok I have two theories on this: the DID find large amounts of fraud but it turns out that it\u2019s all fraud against Biden, not for him Or even Barr is too scared to get sucked into what ever coup attempt trump is trying and is trying to get himself fired before Jan 20 \"Wow, now so called AG Billy Barr stating that there is no fraud, even though ALL know that there is HUGE FRAUD! What is he afraid of? Why such bias in Department of \"J\" against your favorite president, me? Sad!\" - future Trump tweet Attorney General William Barr said his department had found no evidence of the widespread voter fraud Trump alleges, while Rudolph Giuliani vowed to continue his search. His  . Hahaha. It's been a month since the election Rudy, I don't think you're supposed to be searching at this point. But by all means keep looking - maybe you'll find a leprechaun or your long lost dignity. I'll put $10 down saying Trump will shortly go on a tirade about Barr being \"unfit to serve\" and calling for his disbarment. Barr is a liberal plant, I heard it on ONN and Trump told me so in my sleep. He comes to me when I'm on my knees in my dreams I can't wait for what Trump tweets about this. I love to see these asshats eat each other Lmao this is how he gets fired right? Looks like part of Trump's tantrum response is now  . I'm sure Biden is heartbroken to not have to spend time with the overgrown toddler. \u201cWith all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation. We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined. We have many witnesses swearing under oath they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter fraud. As far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the DOJ. The justice department also has an audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth.\u201d Trumps legal team Looks like they\u2019re going to keep crying \u201cWAIT FOR THE EVIDENCE\u201d and never actually bringing anything forward. Barr even shot down the Bogus Dominion Conspiracy Theory, specifically. From the \u201cAP\u201d article: Barr didn\u2019t name Powell specifically but said: \u201cThere\u2019s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything to substantiate that,\u201d Barr said. Expecting Barr to be fired by the end of the week now. No mass arrests, and now this?!?! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Barr's always been a liberal hack. /s He's a piece of shit.  He has done, and can do, a lot for the corrupt as fuck GOP.  But there are still probably some things he can't do it seems. A part of me hopes he gets fired in a real nasty way. I went to see Trump's reaction but he is too busy with some whisleblower conference.  I checked it out, and oh boy, it is idiotic.  Some postal contractor drove a truck with possible ballots in it (of course they are saying upwards of 288,000 but I am sure it is a small fraction of that).  He claims the truck disappeared after he delivered it.  Yeah, someone probably moved it to where it was needed.  Another one is a person claiming to overhear about backdating ballots, and of course postal workers with \"odd behaviors.\"  Who buys this shit?  This isn't whistleblowing.  This is a bunch of idiots making massive leaps in logic, and they aren't insiders.  They have no knowledge of anything.  Just random hearsay and conjecture based on bullshit.  It makes me sick that this kind of shit it trotted out there and people buy into it. edit:  I forgot the other one, a guy who was using a flash drive on some voting machine.  Mind you the person making the claims knows nothing about computers and jumped to all kinds of weird conclusions.  It is insanity. Barr will be fired before the week is out, if not the day. The MAGA idiots will all claim he's part of the \"DEEP STATE\" even though they were his cheerleaders until today. YES! Now Trump will predictably turn on his lackey Barr. Hysterical. Can't wait to watch this shitshow. Great, now it makes ME question the validity of the election results. Fuck off, Barr! Are Conservatives calling Barr a deep state liberal shill yet? Tomorrow\u2019s news: Barr fired by tweet The lesson the GOP will take from this election is that it\u2019s easier to manipulate the vote before than election than after. Expect some insane levels of voter suppression. Can we consider this official notification from Barr that The coup has failed and there will be no Imperial Republican Presidency possible, Barr has milked his position as much as possible without hazarding prison time, and Barr is fine with being fired by Tweet, today. This is strategic. Barr's allegiance has never been to Trump personally, but to the rigid Judeo-Christian moral code that he believes our society is moving away from. His ass came out of retirement to carry water from Trump because Trump was enthusiastically fearmongering with considerable success among the sort of people Barr believes need protecting - white Christians. They wanted the same people up in arms about the same things for entirely different reasons. Barr has protected Trump's ass this whole time because he believed he had a moral and religious obligation to do so, if you can believe that. He will happily slink away back into the shadows now that his useful idiot has been disposed of. Like rats fleeing the sinking ship. They'll all start to distance themselves now. Standing by for a tweet exclaiming how Barr is a criminal and trump had never even met the guy Incoming from the coping maga crowd. \"Bill Barr is a pedo, Q has the proof!\", \"Bill Barr was paid by Soros!\" and you know all the standard stuff they do. Also Trump never met Barr. Boy will Barr be surprised to find out that he is a nasty liberal socialist The toddler-in-chief is going to make boom boom in his diaper when he hears this. Bruh, a dropped Taco could have told you there was no election fraud. Conservatives are going to need some weapons grade copium to deal with this. Quick, Rudy, schedule a press conference at the Ritz wastewater processing plant. Conservatives dragging their Loss out over and over again has been so fun to watch. They are consuming one another. Trumps touch broke the party haha All I know is I'm Kraken open a cold one tonight to celebrate the shitheads slipping and falling in their own mess. Who the fuck idolizes these people as worthy of the highest offices in the land? Oh right, NeoNazis and Alt-Right fuckheads who are 100% okay throwing out legal votes because they can't deal with a loss this large and historical. Welp, if the normal pattern from the White House continues, it looks like Barr is gonna be fired in 3... 2... Like a rat leaping from the sinking USS Trump. It's every swamp creature for itself now. The rats are abandoning the USS DoritoMan. The ship is sinking. In before: \u201cDonald Trump fires Attorney General William Barr\u201d Oh damn, someone's getting fired by tweet tomorrow. I am genuinely shocked, although I am still very suspicious of their intentions. Wow, even Barr is abandoning Trump. Looks like he knows the Trump gravy train is over, and sticking with him will just damage the remains of the Republican Party even further. I'll predict that Barr gets fired on Thursday. Aaaand you're fired. Rats jumping ship. You love to see it. Thank you Dinosaur baby With the Ghouliani news today, seems everyone's abandoning ship. Now the only questions are: 1: Who's going to get scapegoated? 2: Are we ever going to get any real accountability to what's happened in the past 4 years? Trump loyalists are gross if they've supported him this far. It's laughable at this point. When Trump passes away in the next few years, he'll be most remembered for how much of a sore loser he was and it'll leave a giant skidmark on his entire family. Barr wants out before it all falls down but can't just quit. It's a bold strategy. Et Tu Billy? You know it fucking pained him to admit it that dinosaur lookin rat BuT hE sAiD YeT sO tHeReS sTiLL tImE Republicans, probably. I would do anything for love. But I won\u2019t do that I'm shocked, SHOCKED! Well, not that shocked. so has he been fired yet. I will put on the popcorn for everyone. Be right back You can always count on rats to flee a sinking ship, or a dumpster fire. And just like that, William Barr became part of the deep state. When your biggest sycophant is saying it's over, maybe it's time you accept reality. He won't, of course. Why start now? Alternate reality Trumpism will endure after all. I guess he realized the Tucker \"I lost my evidence\" approach wasn't going to work this time. Trump is going to have a twitter meltdown tonight. Really happy I got a bag of popcorn and 2 liter of mountain dew to enjoy the show!!! Thank you! But FUCK YOU, YOU LIVING PIECE OF SHIT. Salt deposits being discovered all over the country because of massive overflow of Republican tears. Holy shit, how far can   move the goalposts, it's insane. The cognitive dissonance is truly stunning. Somwhere today Barr had to explain this to Trump 20 times and Trump still asked, 'so you're telling me there's a chance?' My guess is that this is a last minute effort by Barr to look like he stood up to Trump. Get fired in the eleventh hour, then try to pretend like he had integrity and fought Trump all along. \" BREAKING from CNN: \u00a0 \u201cThe Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon, according to a court record unsealed on Tuesday by the chief judge of the DC District Court.\u201d \" He\u2019s going to be the next one to get death threats. Having said that, how deep into a cult should you be to still think that counting systems were hacked in a state like Georgia when (a) a hand recount gave the same results (b) republicans did better down ballot. Geez people need serious de-programming. Around 30% of this country is mentally fucked. ", "Politics"], "Topic": "Politics"},
{"Megathread: Justice Department Investigating Potential Presidential Pardon Bribery Scheme": ["The Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House or related political committee in exchange for a presidential pardon, according to court records unsealed Tuesday in federal court. I'm not shocked about the bribery. I am shocked the DoJ is investigating. They're probably just angry at the lowball bribe amount This comment will likely get buried since it\u2019s so late but there\u2019s an important element here that people are missing. Barr does not have complete control over every single thing that happens at the DOJ. Yes he\u2019s the head, but if he interfered in every single investigation that Trump wanted him to, he\u2019d have a mutiny on his hands as his entire department would quit on him. The DOJ has a very long history of operating as independently as possible and the career prosecutors and investigators that work for or with the DOJ take that very seriously. Barr has absolutely pushed for bullshit investigations, and he\u2019s definitely influenced some to end early (like the Mueller investigation). But he can\u2019t stop every single investigation. He just can\u2019t. Not while maintaining any semblance of authority within his department. In fact it seems to have gotten to the point that some parts of the DOJ are already more or less mutinying against him in their own quiet respectful ways. Some groups like the SDNY within the DOJ appear to be insisting that they continue to investigate what they believe is worth investigating, regardless of what Barr and Trump think. And their challenge to Barr is basically \u201cif you want me to stop investigating Trump and his businesses, you\u2019ll have to fire me.\u201d  And Barr has fired some people. But the investigations don\u2019t stop because they just get handed off to someone else. Barr would have to burn the department to the ground firing everyone all the way down to the mail clerks before he\u2019d actually get those investigations to stop. He has generally found it easier to try to delay those investigations rather than stop them outright. The institutions that our country is built on are robust and are damned hard to get rid of in 4 years. The damage done to them is going to take a long time to fix, but Trump never stood a chance of completely uprooting them. He lacked the know-how and the popular will of the people. Probably just investigating to find no wrong doing so that when biden gets in he can't reopen a new investigation without looking bad politically This case is from August. The judge gave 90 days for the administration to respond, since it\u2019s been 90 days, it\u2019s released now. Flynn? This is a major scandal that should've leaked during the election. When was Glislaine Maxwell arrested again? This is fucking insane. We\u2019re so incredibly lucky all these people are fucking morons. Can you imagine how fucked we'd be if they had any kind of competence?  I feel like I, personally, could have done a better job at doing or covering up any of these schemes, lawsuits or scandals lol Trump is claiming fake news but the news report doesn't even claim he did anything. So ya, he definitely did something. Kind of like when he said his visit to Walter Reed was definitely not for mini strokes when no one asked or said anything about mini strokes? The fraud is coming from  ! Surprised Pikachu So who is going to ask Susan Collins if Trump learned his lesson? Can\u2019t believe Maine voted her back in ... She'll furrow her brows very convincingly The bombshell investigation became public during a fight over attorney-client privilege that secretly has been underway in federal court in Washington, D.C. since at least Aug. 25 this year, when prosecutors sought permission a judge\u2019s permission to override attorney-client privileged communications because of the crime-fraud exception. Oof. There\u2019s a few lawyers out there sweating bullets right now. News came out today that Rudy is looking for an advanced pardon... I wonder if that could be related to this particular meatball That's a spicy meatball. I think it it going to be something like a conversation between the White House, attorney general and Rudy.  Any conversation about a private topic would lose privilege. The history books about these last four years are going to be  . Don\u2019t forget that they\u2019ll need a Parental Advisory label and the kids will have to get forms signed by their parents to learn the Trump years. This is your evangelical hero? It's going to take all my might not to snap my phone in half over the next 4 years every time Republicans pretend to care about ethics, norms and decorum. They want to continue skating through life like they didn't just spend 4 years trying to help topple the country.  John (thanks correctors) Cornyn stood up, with a straight face, and said one of Biden's cabinet picks shouldn't be seated because she has some uncivil tweets in her history. I can't believe he didn't give himself whiplash. So they've already started. Just wait, all the old favorites will come back... fiscal hawks, anti-war, you name it, they will adopt *any* position as long as it opposes a democrat. Trump is taking the Republican party down from the inside! ABC News confirms:   At that time, the informal conversations focused specifically on whether the president could pardon himself. All these people asking for pardons, I wonder   so many people would feel they need one? Hmm... Pardon investigation is Fake News! So it's confirmed If it gets back to him within a couple of hours and he immediately tweets \u201cfake news\u201d, it\u2019s pretty much an open and shut case. Sprinkle some adderall on him and let\u2019s get out of here. Cool, so he's definitely involved in this scheme then We\u2019ve had first impeachment, what about 2nd impeachment I don\u2019t think he knows about second impeachment, Pip. Elevensies? Just a little reminder about this pardon that Trump granted in February Republicans now say have all these \"affidavits\" that people sworn under oath said they   voter fraud without any physical proof, they call that enough evidence to overturn the election. But when there were people sworn under oath that said Russia interfered with the election and Trump willingly let them help, and that he tried to interfere with investigations into them helping, that wasn't evidence at all to them, they had to have some   evidence. Republicans aren't a party, they are a cult. And the big difference is the people in the Russian investigation   in congress, while the people signing these affidavits for the trump campaign are ghosts.  And they won't show anyone the affidavits because they are \"saving the big guns for the supreme court\". And I don't want anyone to assume it would actually matter if some joe schmo testified in court. It wouldn't They demanded physical evidence in the impeachment trial over Trump extorting Ukraine to try to get them to make up dirt on Biden. Republicans loudly demanded evidence, then blocked the introduction of any evidence at all into the trial. Hey, remember when Republicans shared memes of Obama taking a torch to the constitution and told us how corrupt he was, and then none of his administration officials actually went to jail and tons of this current president\u2019s officials went to jail and now he\u2019s running a pardon racket for them Yeah, good shit Lol they   do this shit over at  . His supporters are so incredibly divorced from reality. They really do believe Trump is some reluctant hero who took it on himself to save America and the Dems are all crooks. Obama Remember   or the   or the  ? Obama mocked our democracy! If I\u2019m reading this right, this tells us the person trying to buy a pardon is already in the federal prison system. Also, someone that surrendered to BOP, not someone that was taken by police or raided. Correct? Couldn\u2019t be Stone then. Name is short too, approx 5 characters. Gen Flynn Michael Cohen Elliott Broidy It appears that the convict who wanted a Trump pardon/reprieve of sentence has a last name that ends in \"s\"  meets all the criteria. Trump He's paying himself to pardon himself. Remember when this kind of thing made Rod Blagojevich resign in disgrace?  Simpler times. Edit: I remembered it wrong.  He was impeached and removed from office by unanimous bipartisan vote.  Guess the difference was the Illinois state senate had integrity. Remember when Trump pardoned that criminal? If Trump isn't prosecuted for his crimes there is no justice in America. I think we all know the answer to this already. Out of all the news coming out in the last day, I\u2019m particularly irritated by trump getting 150+ million dollars in political donations, with no restrictions for personal use, through his \u2018leadership PAC.\u2019 It\u2019s like the cult of trump has now started its own version of a megachurch. Edit: You all are geniuses. Magachurch. I wonder how   will spin this. By now they must have the goal posts on wheels. I think most of the active posters are still convinced Trump will be president on January 21st. And 22nd. And forever and ever amen. I'm tempted to look, but I also don't want to ruin my day. Barr has been radio silent since election day and then came out and dropped some nukes today. Dude is trying to save his own ass. Definitely not IMO. My money\u2019s on Barr wrapping it up quickly and \u201cconfirming\u201d nothing happened in another \u201creport\u201d prior to Biden\u2019s DOJ doing a real investigation. That way they can justify obstructing or not participating in the legitimate investigation. Feels like setting up a continued alternative narrative to me. Fox guarding henhouse. I trust that fascist fuck as far as I can throw him. Maybe this administration has made me cynical. Ghislaine Maxwell has the dirt and money to get a pardon. That's what this is about. imagine all the stuff we don't even know about yet that this administration has done, it's gonna take years of unpacking to sift through it all And now we know why Barr said what he said today. The wind has shifted. How many times is Barr getting fired tonight? Im taking over/unders. No. This is going to be about fucking Joe Exotic. Mark my words. There\u2019s very little room for good news in 2020 My hot take - Barr came out with his statement about the election because the justice department is pursuing shit so serious that he's trying to start distancing himself from the inevitable legal implications for Trump I'm curious as to why that is, because Barr basically believes the President has the authority to do literally anything he wants. If it was up to Barr the president would be an Absolute Monarch. Trump: \"Who do I have to pardon to get a   around here?\" I was wondering why Trump\u2019s camp and QAnon wwre pushing about \u201cHunter\u2019s laptop\u201d.  They just project and accuse others of what they\u2019re guilty of...no real imagination. Turns out one of   laptops was confiscated as evidence back in August. \u201cYou didn\u2019t care about hunters laptop, so why do you care about this one. See we\u2019re being persecuted!\u201d /s Conservative thread is collectively stroking out with this story and Barr poking holes in their fraud conspiracy on the same day. My grandparents like Trump because, in their words, \"He's so rich, nobody can buy him off.\" I was like how do you think he got so rich!? he didn't get so rich.  he's not rich.  he lost all of his dad's money, then he agreed to an illegal money laundering scheme with a bunch of russians where he gets to live off of loans from deutsche bank, and sell property to the russians so they can wash their money.  He's not rich, and as soon as he is no longer POTUS, he's probably going to jail for money laundering, and deutsche bank is going to seize all his properties in order to get their loans repaid since now he can't continue the money laundering. * Chopper Sounds * 2016: Lock her up! 2020: Lock him up! 2021: Pardon my family! I heard on NPR today, that presidential pardons should be taken away.   A possible scenario:  \"The president could order the assisination of a political enemy, then pardon all involved, including himself.  This is what we wanted to get away from the King of England for and was not the intention of the founders.\" I'm over it. Pardons have brought much more controversy and harm than they have brought good. Let's get rid of it As we have seen it play out, a presidential candidate can have   people do questionable or outright illegal things in order to improve his chances at winning the power to absolve them of their crimes if they're ever found out. Just remove the power for the President to pardon himself or anybody in office. Wow, Trump started hating on the GOP and tried to torpedo their Georgia Senate campaigns. GOP activated their sleeper agent Bill Barr to put Trump back into his corner. This is Machiavellian. I like what you\u2019re cooking I want to say this is Qanon level, but... ah... hmmm Biden\u2019s DOJ, better go after every last one of these traitors. Trump is ranting about it already. Therefore it's true and happened. \"The Democrat Russia investigation was a politically motivated hoax, but now that the president is threatening our senate majority, we're going to impeach, pardon, and pretend we never liked him in the first place.\" Mitch McConnell, probably Lmfao, from Dijon Mustard to this. Am I the only one who is still reeling from the fact that we elected this comically simple and depraved imbecile to the highest office in the United States? What an absolute disgrace for this country That\u2019s not even the worst part. The worst part is after four years of proving to everyone he\u2019s the imbecile you say he is, 70+ million people still voted for him. Wow, I can't believe this. It just seems so out of character for Trump. You'd think a guy who has been forcing government employees to stay at his property to enrich him and has been impeached for trying to get a foreign government to announce that they were investigating his opponent would know better. Trump exchanging his Presidential Power for money??? It just doesn't add up. I am shocked. At a White House Christmas party tonight, President Trump told guests, \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing four years. We are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d The COVID Super Spreader Tour: Infected by the Holidaze started tonight I will never forgive the SDNY if they somehow fuck up the case against Trump that's been brewing for a few years now. If I have to still be hearing stories about him in four years that don't deal with him being deceased or in prison, we've fucked up as a country. I didn't put this in my original post, because the quote itself is far too badass to apply to DJT. But the principle does apply: You aim at the king, you best no miss This is one of the biggest scandals in presidential history. Period. How many times has that been said over the past 4 years? Wow it\u2019s almost like all the people with a brain already knew that trump was corrupt, meanwhile you have every idiot in   still thinking trump is going to win this election? It\u2019s insane how dumb people are Gee, it'd be really stupid if the power to pardon could itself be used to avoid consequences for abusing that power. That'd be realllly dumb. Yeah, I sadly expect absolutely no one to see any consequences for this. I wish pardons needed Congressional or Judicial approval. One person should never be allowed to overrule all 3 branches of government. Just allowing for that is asking for corrupt abuse. Were there not red flags when Michael Flynn was pardoned? We need you, Georgia. There was news of Rudy Giuliani  . This meltdown is going to be explosive. (WaPo paywall bypassed) The Justice Department in August investigated a potential \u201cbribery-for-pardon\u201d scheme in which a large political contribution would be offered in exchange for a presidential pardon by the Trump White House, according to court records unsealed Tuesday. The documents show that U.S. prosecutors were scrutinizing whether two individuals approached senior Trump White House officials as unregistered lobbyists, and a related scheme in which cash would be funneled through intermediaries for a pardon or reprieve of a sentence for a defendant a Spencer S. Hsu is an investigative reporter, two-time Pulitzer finalist and national Emmy Award nominee. Hsu has covered homeland security, immigration, Virginia politics and Congress. Food budget is going to be 90% popcorn after today. Oh can you imagine if the Georgia senate flips blue? Could we see the first time that a former US President is indicted on criminal charges? In Stacey we trust! Cohen may be right about Trump taking a Christmas vacation to Mar-a-Lago then disappear and never come back. He\u2019ll pardon himself and his cronies by then. What\u2019s sad is that he\u2019ll walk away with millions of dollars from some of his 70mil supporters that gave him money to fight the election \u201cfraud\u201d Scammer gotta scam. Big oof, everything the republicans have accused the democrats of has all been projection this entire time. Donald Trump only has a talent for scamming people, it\u2019s fitting that he\u2019s still trying to do it at the highest level #Trump4prison2021 This is such a massive fuck you to \u201claw and order\u201d and anyone not named Trump I'm fucking dying to know who it is. The campaign is almost certainly Trump's. I wonder if any of the scum kids are involved? Lol bet the leaks start coming this week. How is it possible-- How is it possible for Barr and Trump to throw each other under the bus when neither one of them will even fit? Considering how absolute the pardon power is, and what a grifter Trump is, I'm surprised he doesn't have a website with a menu/price list of pardons crimes. If there\u2019s ANY justice in this world, trump and all his loyalists should literally be driven to prison on Jan. 20th. Let's not mince words: this is Trump selling pardons. Good CNN segment on this They're dumping Trump's ass like a night out at golden corral. Rats abandoning ship. Trump's turn in the Barrel now. Can the president pardon someone for bribing him for a pardon? And just how much extra does that cost? Asking for   I mean, a friend. The shit winds are changin\u2019 Rand. Republican leadership must be concerned about the Georgia run-offs. This feels like they're throwing Trump under the bus to distance him from the party. \"The Senate has spoken. Beware the Ides of March.\" Plot Twist: The bus Barr and Trump are trying to throw each other under is parked on top of the swamp. There was always plenty of room underneath for both. As seen on Twitter... \"big fucking deal....all presidents have done what Trump's done\" \"You mean use his office to get rich, appointed his family, pardons for sale, yada yada\" \"Fucking Biden better not try that shit..we are watching\" \"Pay for pardon\" was   plot turn at this point in the series. Writers were feeling lazy. \"I'm never going to financially recover from this\"-Donald J. Exotic Barr: The power of a president is near absolute and oversight cannot be enforced because Jesus. Also Barr: Unless he is acting against the Party on a loser's way out. Barr announcing an investigation into Trump's illegal activity feels like a police union investigating its own misdeeds. \"We've found ourselves absolutely innocent. Good job, guys. No need to investigate further. Nothing to see here\". Who could possibly have seen this coming from such an ethical, moral, law-abiding administration? /s At this rate Trump will get on a submarine to Moscow within a fortnight If Trump's corruption could take a physical form, it would be a Russian nesting doll. It's almost popcorn time! melt some butter in a small saucepan, just 2 tbsp will do add a pinch of dried rosemary that's been bruised with the side of a knife keep the butter on low and pop your corn dump the popcorn  into your favorite bowl and pour that hot butter over it and toss add a 1/4 cup shredded fresh parmesan cheese and toss again enjoy with a little salt to taste! If its the fucking tiger king.... Would be the most 2020 shit ever We can't even have the lame duck period be normal in this administration. We have to have a full fledged impeachment level scandal that would torpedo most other presidents. The GOP must go the way of the Whigs. \"Getting the attention of a President so they know more about your legal situation is not bribery, it's smart politicking.\" - Hannity and Carlson tomorrow, probably So one of my lingering questions: how many pardons does he appear to have sold already? I mean, I think for a long time there's been a lot of suspicion, and even speculation about this happening, but I have a hard time believing it's just one, now that this story is out. The Justice Department had sought to keep the investigation private because the court documents describe \"invididuals and conduct\" that are not yet subject to prosecution, Reuters reported. I absolutely cannot wait for the documentaries in the years to come \u201cBreaking: Justice Department Seeks to Uphold the Law\u201d Just when you think they've hit bottom, Trump hauls out a backhoe and establishes yet a new low. I'm currently watching MSNBC and I'm sure it's taking everything the anchors have not to scream \"   \" into the camera. Mind you, I may be paraphrasing. \"All we found was this bag of money and a note from Rudy Giuliani that says 'pardon me, Donnie, I think you dropped this'. \"I mean, that could be anybody....\" I just want to post in a thread that might be in a history book in the future. If Joe Exotic is the one who inadvertently brings down Trump once and for all... 2020 bout to end the way it began. Nah man... Trump learned his lesson when he was impeached. Didn't you hear Susan Collins? So many people are going to be covering their asses now because Biden and his team has access to classified materials and can probably see the crimes being committed in detail. This is so fucking great lol. trump supports fingers in their ears going LA LA LA LA LA Is anyone surprised? A grift until the last day. No shit. You\u2019ve got a crooked asshole in office who\u2019s tried to profit off the presidency since the start. This fucking clown will try it now til the end. i mean, obviously. no one is shocked that pardons are for sale. we\u2019d expect nothing less at this point. This is just lazy writing from the producers of 2020. So is Cocaine Mitch just gonna pretend like he doesn\u2019t read the news? Trump is openly   to sabotage the Georgia runoffs and the GOP is just bracing and pretending like this isn\u2019t a freak-show. Then this shit drops. Like, how TF can they even spin this? I'm shocked... SHOCKED I say! Must have been a Black Friday sale I wonder the going rate for a presidential pardon Soooo...is   the Kraken? Cynical side of me thinks that they're \"investigating\" this because Barr wants to end it quickly with the least evidence and most miniscule punishment possible and prevent the Biden administration from doing a more thorough investigation. Find out what   the   uses to  Sweet, another investigation that will lead to no convictions! Look I know we already won more or less but can we   just impeach him a second time for the fun of it? Any chance the guy fixin to buy freedom is Joe Exotic? That\u2019d be peak 2020. \"Dude, I spent $100,000 at your hotel so you owe me biggly!\" Time to play guess what's blacked out P. 15 \"This political strategy to obtain a presidential pardon was \"parallel\" to and distinct from [Giuliani-sized blackout]'s role as an attorney-advocate for [Trump-sized blackout].\" 2020 where you have a better chance of buying yourself a pardon than an RTX 3080 Or a Playstation 5 SECTION 4. The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason,  , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. We moved past treason and are here now? edit for html class failing me I think everyone had \u201ctrump accepting cash bribes for favors\u201d on their bingo cards. Y'all....Trump just tweeted that this is Fake News. He's definitely involved. Trump\u2019s next book will probably be named \u201chow I would fuck up America, if I did it..\u201d People need to stop getting their hopes up. Look up Barr's history. Look up the history of any of these Republicans that have been pretending to turn against the problems they caused. Whatever they do, they do to protect a WASP Republican-led authoritarian oligarchy.^ They're extremely good at playing the long game and sacrificing people along the way. They know how to get their small victories and twist their failures to work for their plans. Barr has done exactly nothing to harm the Republican effort to continue trying to establish an oppressive society. For goodness sake please stop pretending this makes anything better. They're setting the nation up for a truly scary situation. This wasn't even released by the DOJ.  The court/judge found it and released it.  DOJ may have talked to reporters to get ahead of the release, but this isn't Barr/DOJ suddenly becoming ethical. The good thing is we'll have new DOJ leadership soon, so if they have a slam dunk case, they'll pursue it. I just donated to NPR for this. Support the news! Objective news is essential for our nation to make it through this whole thing and thrive. If this ends up being Joe Exotic, the musical for 2020 (or the Trump presidency) has practically written itself. A reprise of a number (Tiger King) from the first act (Lockdown) right before the curtain. Get writing, theatre kids! Remember when Obama pardoned Sasha and Malia Trump not being removed from office by Senate Republicans has only emboldened him and his cronies. I really hope Biden appoints someone who will look at all the evidence and indict these scumbags. The country can't begin to heal from the last four years unless all the people involved in this corrupt administration face consequences. It also sends a message to any future would be autocrats waiting to get elected. Sounds an a lot like what Rod Blagojevich went to prison for. Whatever happened to him.... oh right, Trump commuted his sentence:   Trump is going to pardon them for the crime of seeking to bribe Trump for a pardon, and then Trump will pardon himself for accepting the bribe. I honestly want to avoid being conspiratorial, there is enough of that going on, but this makes me wonder if this is what Barr and McConnell had been meeting about. Barr announces no evidence of fraud and a basically bombshell investigation, within a day of Trump retweeting \"why even vote Republican?\" Makes me wonder if Mitch was like \"if he starts endangering the party, use this.\" Wait??? Is Barr investigating Trump? Did anyone really think he would pardon someone for free? What the actual fuck lmao? I mean why am I not surprised? Someone should come up with one of those cool latin sounding phrases for when you ask someone to do for me and I do for you. Corruption? In this White House? Surely not! /Capitol S It\u2019s like, the fraud that Trump was saying was all projection... Gaslight Obstruct Project Good ol\u2019 GOP. Any one of the news in last four years would have been the biggest scandal of an administration. But here we are, scandal after scandal even in its dying days this administration is trying hard to keep clinging to power and somehow subvert democracy. Cherry on top would be if the president is indeed selling his power. Also those who are saying Trump had no idea and if it is true that will make him the biggest useless and an impotent president in our country\u2019s history. I wonder if the concept of legacy ever shoots past his brain? He seems to be doing a good job in cementing his place as one of the worst presidents in US history. As long as Barr is the one in charge over there, nothing will be done. People joked he would do this, people thought it was silly to even consider, yet here we are. Anyone know what they\u2019re saying over at  ? Too scared to look lol My conservative friend already wants barr tried for treason, even before knowing who is offering the bribe, what evidence exists, whether trump knew or not, and who the recipient might be. That's how deep the anti- sentiment is right now Lol   is so lost that they instead are complaining about the amount of rewards being given out than focusing on the substance of what just went down today. Fuck em. They were acting like a bunch of smug pricks and patting each other on the back for handling the loss well on election night unlike the libruls and then proceeded to spend a month crying about bullshit fraud. Imagine wasting all that money trying to bribe a pardon out of Trump.... when you could've just gone on Fox News and told him he was pretty. When Barr leaves, do not give him the patriot treatment. fuck him. When he leaves the Whitehouse he'll probably try to take the furniture. I can\u2019t wait for the HBO miniseries about the Trump administration. No matter what happened, or what we find out about it (publicly or redacted)- it wont be enough for the 43% who fucking voted for this cesspool of treason to see how they fucked up. If Joe Exotic ends up being the guy that brought trump down I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the ending we all deserve I say. Hahaha...all Trumpland is glued to the news circa 7pm tonight to hear \"the cnn taped phone calls\" dump by O'Keefe and this comes out instead. Please Georgia vote Democrat!  Please undo all this BS!  We deserve a respectable country with a respectable democracy! So this means that a lot of stuff will be unsealed also on Jan. 20th I'm kind of expecting FBI just camped outside Maralago. I think this is great because this will give Biden's incoming Attorney General a reason to assign a special investigator to expand the investigation in any potential aspect of the Trump Campaign and/or White House administration, and there is an existing investigation already underway that they can simply say that they are continuing. \"All the pardons were purchased by bots and we do not know when more will be in stock.\" Trump might as well have advertised his Pardons For Sale on Amazon's Black Friday page. I\u2019m sure Trump\u2019s kids, Kushner and Rudy are taking orders for pardons like they are working at a Chick-Fil-A drive thru Anyone guess how much. I\u2019d say $125k I never thought I'd have to say this twice in one day, but someone, anyone, go check on those cheek-clapped fellows at  . Why do I have feeling they are going to wrap up the investigation on January 19 and decide there was no wrong doing. All while Trump pardons himself, Giuliani, Barr, and every Republican until the end of time for \u201cstuff\u201d ", "Politics"], "Topic": "Politics"},

Is there a word for someone who's worse than a psychopath, who like enables other psychopaths and actively creates and beats down already weakened, at risk targets for them? Fascist.  They want fascism. Parasites Mitch. The word is Mitch. Although there isn't scientific consensus, in common discussions the past 10-20+ years, sociopath is generally used as synonymous with a more clever and devious version of a psychopath. The latter can torment those closest to them and they are more likely to act publicly as what one expects a psychopath to act like while the former may be able to present themselves as normal and tries to obtain more power and / or hurt more people in a way that is less blatant than than a psychopath would. Either way, it is fcked up we have organized ourselves in such a way that it attracts people like that to positions of power (both government and at the top of companies) and often rewards their behavior, unless they hurt someone physically on a direct personal level. Like a small minority of the population with essentially a selfish and destructive mental illness are ruling over us and it's not just an issue in the US. Literally psychopath Police officer? Ghouls? Malignant  narcissist aka narcissistic psychopath aka Donald Trump A tremendous psychopath, a very big psychopath from the standpoint of mental disorders? Republicans sounds fitting. Crimes against humanity Americans Republicans have no position.  They argue in bad faith.  They are psychopaths as their only goal is personal power with no actual desire to do their jobs for the sake of the People. Their entire ideology is that it's bad for them to do the job they were elected to do. They are the antithesis of progressives: they are regressives, obstructionists and contrarians at best. They argue in bad faith Their whole ideology is bad faith. That is the fuel that keeps them in power. If it was not for double standards, Republicans would have no standards at all. They want civility and compromise after the last 4 years, ongoing assaulting of the institution of voting, and telling Biden that he basically won't get anyone he wants in his cabinet to be confirmed.  Cool beans. The party has no platform left and is just a reactionary movement. The last Republican for President I would vote for is George  Bush Sr. The sane Republicans left are the ones in New England/Northeast Exactly. Their only position is \u201cif it helps our party, we support it. If it hurts our party, we are against it.\u201d From that perspective, opposing the nomination of merrick garland and supporting the nomination of ACB is perfectly consistent. The GOP loves to control people who are not them This is the lesson for all who can actually open their eyes to the truth. This is why you always, always vote against Republicans.   Never miss the opportunity. There was a time when I gave consideration to both candidates and carefully weighed the pros and cons of their respective positions. That's over. The GOP is clearly fine with an attempt to plunge our nation into naked fascism. They are simply too dangerous to ever be allowed within spitting distance of the levers of power. Until that party dissolves and is replaced by an actually sane party, I'll just be checking Democrat on my ballots from now on. I hate that I'm reduced to one effective choice (and fuck off, Greens and Libertarians; I've already looked into you and don't like either one of you). Dead right. Even if you identify as conservative you still shouldnt. Why? Because what they say and what they do are never the same thing. Democrats may not do everything they say either, but usually its for practical reasons. Either they are obstructed from doing so, or situations change. However Republicans promise a lot, but have no intention of actually giving it to you.. See abortion bans. Vote against *low education easily manipulated misinformed self victimized dolts. This is why you always, always vote against Republicans.   Never miss the opportunity. Specifically in a way that will prevent them from being in power. We can only divide and argue over policies after we get the positions of power, or we'll never see the policies we want enacted. There is no such thing as a protest vote. For four years Republicans in Congress pretended not to know what outrageous and dangerous things trump was tweeting but it turned out that they were all laser focused on Neera Tanden's twitter feed. For ten years they have ruled on rank hypocrisy and outright obstruction of governance. Don't let them forget that. You don't get to tell Merrick Garland to fuck off 3/4 of a year before an election, install Amy COVID Barrett less than a month before one, and then pretend you have a solitary moral principle in your being. You have proven beyond any doubt that your character is one of malice, partisanship, and hypocrisy. I'm sure that they were also hyper aware of anything AOC said...or Kamala Harris...or Ilhan Omar...or Ayanna Pressley...or Susan Rice...or Rashida Tlaib...or Maxine Waters... really, the list is endless. Republicans feel she is a safe target because she is a woman and she had the audacity to criticize Trump and the republicans.  Imagine that! \u201cWhat\u2019s a twitter? I don\u2019t know what he said on that\u201d Any time one of these complicit pieces of trash says anything about decorum, tweets, etc. etc. The answer is \"fuck off\". I like how Sheldon Whitehouse put it: \"Don\u2019t think when you have established the rule of \u2018because we can,\u2019 that should the shoe be on the other foot, you will have any credibility to come to us and say: \u2018yeah, I know you can do that, but you shouldn\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cYour credibility to make that argument at any time in the future will die in this room and on that Senate floor if you continue.\u201d Just use Trump's own words against them - \"I'm telling it like it is!\" or \"covfefe, baby!\" Absolutely, fuck them and their bad faith arguments.  Don't give them a chance to spout their bullshit.  Shut it down. This needs to be a thing. We can't allow these rats back into the daylight as if nothing happened. They also want fiscal responsibility now. On behalf of most of reddit and many Americans, they can go fuck themselves.  I apologize for my bad language. Medicare for all is fiscally responsible. Called it. Not like it was difficult to predict that Republicans would be lying hypocrites again. That's the core of the Norquist plan. Republicans wreck the budget and the economy, then when Democrats take power, they have to fix the whole country, again. When out of power the Republicans shout about how much \"entitlements\" cost and demand the programs be cut in the name of fiscal responsibility. Never mind the fact that Republicans never pay for their programs and tax cuts, or that it's Republicans who ran up the deficit. They'll just lie, claim it was the Democrats, and their supporters will believe them because Republican voters are the only thing worse than Republican politicians. It\u2019s literally the same thing every time the power swings to Democrats. Balls in the Democrats court, they need to grow a spine and stop putting up with the bullshit. They can complain about how unfair the Republicans are, but until they start voting the same way that they speak publicly, they\u2019re as bad if not worse then the Republicans. Democrats have a track record of doing the same shit Republicans do, only spinning it in a tepid manner. fuck them. ignore their corrupt, spineless fucking asses. god i\u2019m not even American and i\u2019m so saturated with disdain for the fucking repuvlicans They are all complicit in his criminality.  They had a chance to convict him in the Senate trial but they wouldn't even call a single witness to the stand.  Sham trial, sham party, sham president. It is hilarious, they had a chance to address real fraud during the impeachment, yet voted not to. Now the republicans are going around to various hotels holding \"hearings\" about election fraud. Nope. They don\u2019t get to ask for that shit this late in the game. I\u2019m shitting myself hoping we get those two Democratic senate seats in GA. Republicans have no room bargaining and should be treated the same way they treated the Democrats all this time. And best part is Moscow Mitch will lose Don\u2019t get your hopes up. In its entire history Georgia has done the right thing approximately twice. Comment from a different post: I know there\u2019s a lot of optimism on here around Ossoff and Warnock, and I\u2019ll be voting for them myself, but I think they\u2019re going to lose and it\u2019s not even gonna be close. Democrats aren\u2019t gonna turn out like they did in the general and you can be sure R\u2019s will. Warnock\u2019s general was against 19 other people. If you just look at D vs R on those results it\u2019s 48% D vs 49% R. But if you look at the front runners who accounted for 79% of the total vote (Warnock, Loeffler, Collins), it\u2019s 42% D vs 58% R. I think he\u2019s gonna lose big. I think Ossoff has a chance because he was only down 1.8% and his messaging has been on point while Perdue\u2019s has been a bit flat (obviously just my opinion). Plus, let\u2019s just be real, he\u2019s white and this is still Georgia. All the numbers above are just my quick math from data on AP election results. I would love to take both seats, but realistically I think we\u2019ll be fortunate if we even get one in Ossoff. Rats leaving a sinking ship for now... Don't underestimate how strong a base Trump has, and how much the Republicans will need to play into that for years to come if they ever want to re-gain the presidency. It's fun watching Trump meltdown but it just makes him all the more dangerous in the weeks, months and years to come. This isn't over. That's unfair to rats. Rats don't typically sink the ship they're on. Anyone taking bets on who the first GOP Senator will be to say \u201cTHE pReSiDeNt iS NoT AbOvE ThE LaW!\u201d? Lindsey. JK Mitt and Susan. They wouldn't have brought this up if our shitty political media hadn't have let them get away with it in the past.  They're very likely to get away with it again now. The GOP spent 8 years obstructing literally everything Obama tried to accomplish in office. Biden should learn a lesson from that and ignore the GOP as much as possible.  If he does that, there will be 1000 think pieces and panel discussions everywhere from Fox News to the NYT decrying the Democrats' \"inability to compromise.\" Which honestly might be a good thing.... IF we retake GA then the GOP will loose their minds... that could lead to passing reform where the majority can't hold everything hostage....   #Maybe Here's the thing:  They wouldn't act like this if their voters objected. Right... The voters are the ultimate problem here And that's exactly what their endless propaganda on Fox News and every fanatical right wing outlet is for - control, manipulation; to ensure they do keep supporting a party that has no interest in advancing their own lives, while the benefactors of fascism and corruption hoard their piles wealth offshore and joke about the ignorance and accomplishments of the brainwashing that's occurred to 70 million people. It's just hilarious, isn't it? / s Their voters act against their own self interest, and by extension  , because the lies their leaders and pundits tell them are the most profitable arrangements for the people pulling the strings - shareholders and donors. They don't even need to be convincing lies because they forced logic and reason out the door 40 years ago and their rabid hatred and intolerance make their decisions for them. The GOP is a white nationalist organization that festers like roaches to reveal themselves every few decades. It's why we need to put the hammer down on them and end the tolerance of their racism and bigotry that have taken over the SC and Senate. Obama campaigned on \"Hope\" and \"Change\"and failed us. This allowed these traitors to destroy this country through retrogression and a complete take overs of the courts that led to Trump. It's now time to fix that and   the tolerance of these fascists. The GOP is a white nationalist organization This. 1000 fucking times this. Learn about  .   is a great primer, also available in the   podcast format. I'll edit if I misquoted him and I can find the place in BtB where Robert Evans says it, but I found this statement salient: There is a direct throughline from the   to the present-day GOP. What I want to know is how the hell did the Texas Rio Grande Valley swing so heavily in favor of Trump in 2020?  This area is almost entirely Hispanic; Hidalgo County for example was 91% Hispanic in 2015. Are the Hispanics there that much in favor of a white supremacist, anti-immigration dictator in charge? Destroy the GOP and conservatism or the country will fail. This is the best tl;dr I could make,   reduced by 88%. (I'm a bot) In another parallel to Trump, congressional Republicans were deferential not only because they considered McCarthy an ally, but also because they recognized him as a potential threat. It was years before his reign of terror was ended and one of the few Republicans who stood up against him, Sen. Ralph Flanders of Vermont, told the truth about what had happened: \"The responsibility for this thing lies squarely on the heads of the Republicans who have been obsessed with the value of McCarthy to the party. We are reaping what they have sown.\" We are seeing a return to the smarmy, sanctimonious, \"Adults in the room\" pretense of Republicans who will wring their hands over Democrats' alleged incivility and partisanship - toward Donald Trump, the crudest, most insulting brute in American politics since Joseph McCarthy.  |   |   |    :          Republicans after they win an election:  Republicans after they lose an election:   Bald faced hypocrisy. The regressives never act in good faith. It's time to just laugh in their face when they try their hypocritical pearl clutching. Republicans prey on the weak minded. This is how they work and have for most of my life. Which is why I distrust most republicans and Christians. They\u2019ve never earned it, but have shown why they don\u2019t deserve it hundreds of times over I'm convinced that republican households produce lots of childhood trauma that never gets resolved unless the child moves away. So many of them adopt toxic behaviors that they display like a badge of honor. Oh we were just pretending so we could raise money and if it succeeded we would have been so shocked and surprised like Cheeto winning in 2016 but now that it's not working and fundraising is winding down we want a seat at the table again!!! Traitors.  America really should prosecute people like this. Research suggests that 1 percent of the population meets the criteria for psychopathy, so yes, I'm pretty sure a majority of elected Republicans could easily be actual psychopaths. The Republican position is \u201cI win and you lose.\u201d This is not a change of position. The Democrat position is \u201cwe can all win, together,\u201d which is dangerously antithetical to the Republican platform. Republicans would rather \u201cwe all lose\u201d than Democrats win, because then at least the basis of their platform would be justified. I am bothered by the Republican narrative that Democrats didn\u2019t accept the election results 4 years ago. Questioning the wisdom of the electoral system which ignores the overall popular vote is not the same as trying to overturn the results of a legal election, which was lost both in the popular vote and electoral college, by any means necessary. \"You've all seen this movie before\", said Turtle Man, \"Now excuse us while we fuck you in the ass.\" Psychopaths? Yes. They care about money and power more than human suffering. That's Grade A standard psychopathic behavior. Edit: Actually that's not fair. Many republicans   human suffering more than money and power. The Republican party has a bipolar personality. They could burn the whole government to the ground and build a new efficient government small enough to fit in a lobbyist's pocket   they might suggest  You'll have to wait until they get out of bed today to find out which. It does not matter what Republicans think they are. We know. The GOP is a bunch of treacherous, lying, hypocritical traitors. Fuck em all. Civility will return when they are gone, their ideology destroyed and publicly shat on and their extremist leaders and members in jail where they belong. Republicans should be treated without political mercy, fuck em! It's no surprise. That's the kind of people they are. When they have power they're violent, cruel, and merciless. They don't want to compromise they want to win. Without power they're terrified of being oppressed, because oppressing others is what they'd do with power, so they preach peace and civility. Think of it this way. They'll beat up weaker people just to make sure that weaker person knows their place, but if a stronger person comes along and hits them for any reason they start crying and screaming about how violence is wrong, even if their victim is still laying on the ground bleeding. They love hurting others, hate being hurt. Just a bunch of cowards. Yes. Yes, they are. Are we still pretending they have a sense of shame? They are lying,narcissistic,misogynistic,psychopaths. Are they actually psychopaths? Yes, yes they are. I think we all predicted this. Grifting Old Pricks All GOP Members are Traitors to the US. It's open and close why aren't we just saying it? No one should be surprised.  This is the game they've been playing for three decades. Suddenly they will care about the deficit, national security, NATO, quality cabinet appointments. The GOP is full of shit. Fine, they can get the ball rolling by passing some damn bills that have been waiting in limbo for years. There can be no civility when they're letting people die to score political points. Bunch of hypocrites It baffles me how many can see a psychopath in action over the long term and repeatedly ask questions like \u201cCan this person really be a psychopath?\u201d Yes.  Yes they fucking can. Sometimes I think I\u2019m magic. I recognize these people long before most other people do. It\u2019s really baffling. The question I\u2019m constantly asking is \u201cHOW DO YOU NOT SEE THIS?\u201d Everyone needs to realize that absolutely no one in politics gives a shit about being a hypocrite. The Republican party is the political equivalent of that shithead kid who always called time out right before you tagged him. The little asshole who insisted he got to be first player at your house because he was the guest, but got to be first player at his house because it was his house. The bully who cried bloody murder when you swung back. They deserve no special consideration or handling. well, I'm never gonna forget this and neither should anyone else I believe that what they have been saying for the last four years has been \"Fuck your feelings\"? Yes. And nazis. And traitors. All republicans are the same. Anyone who can see people protest and rally with nazi and confederate flags and say, \u201cYeah I\u2019m glad I\u2019m with this party.\u201d Are just ignorant, arrogant, filth. I will never vote for another Republican they did this to themselves They can get fucking bent for all I care. Never voting Republican again after this bullshit. And while I'm at it, some Dems can get bent too. Child caging nazis fuck off I am happy to talk civily to any Republican civilian, but likewise, any GOP politician can eat my asshole. Fuck the fascist GOP. This is their normal playbook. They do all the terrible shit and then gaslight the Democrats when they come back into power. They raised the deficit, but they will spend the next four years blaming dems for it. They abused the system, and will spend the next four years ignoring what they did and claiming that the system is broken and the dems are abusing it. The Republican's know exactly what they are doing. They fight dirty, the Dems try to stay above it and be civil, and they get taken advantage of. Every. Single. Cycle. I am so greatful for the young Dem's that are saying FUCK THAT. And fighting back. Not by going down to the Republican's level, but taking the high road and shining a painful spotlight on the reprobates. Calling them out, and then loudly pursuing change. There can't be enough Bernie Sanders and AOC's in the Dem's. We need more, and we need them now. Come back baby, it will be different this time. The best thing to happen to this country would be for the GOP to fracture into the pompous traditionalists and the bat-shit crazy MAGA conspiracy theorists, effectively neutralizing them both on a national scale. This is what happens to your brain after 4 years of defending an actual psychopath. You lose all sense of up and down. They can't keep their stories straight. I\u2019m not a fan of either party but republicans disgust me at this point. They chose party over country. They shouldn\u2019t be forgiven. If you are willing to disregard the path you took to appease a wannabe dictator, you don\u2019t deserve to represent the American people. How can they be trusted? Are politicians psycopaths?!? Gasp, it almost as we forgot that most of these people were   basically acting above the law way before Trump was on the scene. Too many republicans are simply schoolyard bullies; they throw their weight around and kick kids when they're down, but as soon as the teacher shows up or the kids decide to group together, they suddenly are all about fairness and equality. Send Melania with her be best narrative to straighten them out since it worked so well with the loser she's married to.\ud83d\ude02 The only thing you can count on a Republican to be is a hypocrite.  They want you to follow their rules and one of their rules is they get to ignore laws and norms.  Why?  Because fuck you,  that's why. They always sing a different song when they\u2019re out of power. They\u2019re already complaining about the deficit. They are the ones that ran it up. It\u2019s the usual formula. Outrageous abuse of power when in office, then wailing and clutching your pearls about deficits and moral turpitude when Democrats are. The template is so plainly obvious, but orc muggles never notice or punish them for it. Their voters never punished them. The victory was never about being truthful or good. The victory was in convincing their voters that Democrats are bad - like, literally evil. And it works. Why wouldn\u2019t they keep doing it? I used to say Republicans lack cognitive dissonance, but honestly this goes way beyond even that. I may not always like Democrats but at least they\u2019re fairly consistent in the application of rhetoric Democrats are also more likely to recognize and turn on a bad leader. One reason why Trump originally won is many democrats didn't want to vote for another Clinton. Republicans would vote for Starlin as long as it's on the GOP ticket. Anything to not vote for commie democrats. Pretty sure Biden is the one asking for \u201cUnity\u201d. #cnntapes Civility... That would have been nice one time in the past 4 years. Exactly and trump is the great divider-in-chief. It's going to be a slog, but it's light years ahead of where we were. Nobody They've always been at war with Eastasia. Unless/until the republican voting base starts caring about their leaders acting in good faith, demonstrating ethical behavior, being civil, and doing things the legal way, this is how the political right is going to behave in America. It is disheartening to see so many millions of people in the United States vote for candidates in a party that flat refuses to respect the office of the president or our allies. Far too many people here seem cool with the fascistic tendencies displayed by today's republican party. Lie, cheat, steal, protect a scumbag, and still expect civility? They should be offered a heaping helping of \u201cget fucked.\u201d I think sociopath is more apt. Call the wahmbulence. Hopefully people have seen the ol' bad faith two-step enough times to recognize it and push back this time... We'll see. Then maybe damn Mitch McConnell could try working with Democrats and moderate Republicans to get something done. What a joke. Bunch of posers When will US change from two party system to multiparty system? gaslighting 101. The only conservative christian value is power Trump Lawyers: \u300aInsert Name\u300bshould be taken out and shot. Next day:  It was just a joke, come on!!! TRUMPCULT. Republicans can shove their 'ethics and civility' up their asses. Want nothing to do with these people. Anyone surprised by this behavior from the GOP shouldn\u2019t be. Yes, and it's our duty to point out their hypocrisy and to ignore their complaints. We must not allow Republicans to shape the narrative at this point. They've abdicated their responsibilities to this country for too long. They do this every time. It shouldn't really shock anyone. Republicans are bad people and can fuck off forever. The only good Republicans stopped calling themselves that years to months ago because they saw what was going on (proud of you, Dad). I'm serious. I don't want to work with anyone who still supports Trump at this point. I don't want to   with anyone who does. I've honestly considered asking my clients if they support Trump as a screening question. Is water wet? They are worse than psycopaths, they are sociopaths. Psycopaths are obvious, sociopaths are insidious. For too long we have let our plutocratic overlords tell these gaslight fairy tales about the responsible republicans and the profligate democrats.  We must stop accepting the fairy tail. We must understand that these people are all acting in their own self interest. Interest which is largely built on a racist, sexist, classist platform. I have for so long tried to see both sides as equally legitimate but I just can't anymore. Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of issues with certain democrats as well, but holy hell the whole republican party is just fucking trash. The entire economic platform is inherently selfish, and their \"wholesome American family religious values\" based social platform is nothing but socially harmful and antiquated bullshit trying to get the world to conform to their ass-backwards interpretation of a 2000 year old book.  And it's all just a facade for unregulated private industry so the wealthiest and most powerful people/corporations can continue doing whatever the fuck they want. There is no longer any redeeming quality in the political right in this country. There are 2 groups of republican voters People who are wealthy enough to actually benefit from republican economic policies who selfishly vote in their own self interest at the detriment to society as a whole (worsening economic inequality, stripping of environmental protection, the list goes on) People who are dumb enough to be convinced to actively vote against their own self-interest (this is the   majority) It's become increasingly clear: republicans yell and make a scene when you try to do good things for the country or for the people.  When you try to do bad things for the country, they go silent. So let that be your barometer going forward. This is what happens when there are no actual consequences for breaking the rules or the laws. When you can lie, cheat, steal, and commit crimes publicly without penalty or punishment, many people will opt to do these things. And usually, but in fairness not always, they are Republicans.  Perfectly exemplifies why so many of these people are so pro religion because in all honesty without the moral and righteous direction given them by the Lords commandments, they would literally not even know right from wrong. I don't think religion generally makes much difference in people's \"moral compass\". Whether atheist, agnostic, or devout believer, a person has tremendous capacity to rationalize any decision. And peer-group pressure and tribalism can make a lot of people gradually -- or swiftly -- crash through their own boundaries. Why else would so many \"good people\", in myriad cultures, get behind authoritarian demagogues and the harms and horrors they perpetrate? Why do so many \"good people\" get drawn in to genocides? I think Philip Zimbardo's \"The Psychology of Evil\" is one of the best TEDtalks ever. The GOP won this election. They packed the courts, pushed thru an unprecedented 3 justices in 4 years, made gains in the house, and held the Senate. They did all of this without the consent of the majority and on the losing end of a landslide popular vote. The only thing that they conceded was Trumps dumb ass which they wanted to get rid of anyways. If the democrats fail to get prosecutions that result in actual prison terms then they so shouldn't even bother showing up Jan 20th. Why do we even let them speak? When the Republicans were in charge everything a Democrat said was disregarded. Ignore their voices. Turn off their microphones. Win Georgia. Shut them out of every bill. Their intentions are clear, make Democrats look bad at any cost, pay back their corporate Masters. I can't wait for senate Democrats to be like \"y'know, maybe this time they mean it, we should really try to work together!\" Did anyone *not* see this coming? It was pretty obvious from the beginning that they were gonna ride him as far as they could, use him and his rabid idiot fanbase to get whatever legislation they wanted, then when reality caught  up pretend they didn't know about any of his many, many crimes and act like they never supported him and are shocked and appalled. They started this war. We should finish it. We need to criminalize the GOP. Make the proud boys into a terrorist organization, and financial support for it, or membership of it should come with a 5 year+ jail sentence. Take ICE apart, and send every single officer who is guilty to jail for decades. Take the CIA and NSA operatives who supported mass surveillance on american citizens to JAIL. Every single officer who broke their oath to the constitution because they were \"following orders\" needs to pay the price. The words of the chain of command are fickle. The constitutional rights of americans and the bill of rights supercedes them, and for breaking the fourth ammendment, the  NSA needs to be imprisoned. They need to be made an example of for future cia and nsa officers. And while we are at it, the business licenses of right wing organizations needs to be revoked on the grounds of promoting information that caused deaths of people who believed them. Specifically covid denial. They need to be brought to trial, and public executions need to be levied against the ceos who let this slide. The anchors who parroted the lines need to be publicly shamed, and banned from newsmedia for life. And the churches who supported all of this shit while not paying taxes need to be relabeled into tax organizations. They need to pay back taxes for 7 years, and if the churches go broke, the pastors who spouted garbage to their congregants to support political candidates from the pulpit need to be held financially liable for the back taxes. If they can't pay, they go to jail for tax evasion. 10 years. And when the gop rushes to get their rifles, we let them assemble on the field of battle. Then we roll out the US military to round them up, disarm them, and give them all 3 year sentences doing community service. Democrats simply need to muster up the guts to fight back. Coordinate. Plan. For example, every single fucking nominee needs to start their prepared statement with the same thing, something along the lines of: Before I begin, I want to publicly state that neither I or anyone in my immediate family arranged to meet with Russian agents in order to acquire stolen property from a political rival. Seriously...throw it in their fucking faces at every opportunity. The best way to not allow them to get away with it is to be persistent in reminding them of their actions and pointing their hypocrisy every time they try to hide it. While I recognize the need for the left to reach out to the less visible, and far less toxic centrists and sane conservatives, compromising with fascists is a mistake. Remember Chamberlain before World War II? \u2018Peace in our time?\u2019  Yeah. That worked out great. You don\u2019t compromise with cancer. You eradicate it from the host body if you want the host body to live. Fuck these traitors.  Anyone with an (R) in front of their name is a Russian as far as I'm concerned Yes they are What clued you in? last time I checked, they are closer to sociopath than psychopath, anyway,  neither of which is a trait you want   someone to have for a job that important The modern Republican Party has much in common with those YouTube \u201cpranksters\u201d who run up behind random strangers and hit them on the head, only to run away screaming, \u201cIT\u2019S JUST A PRANK BRO!\u201d They are currently at the running and screaming stage. I hope one of them goes full Trump & says,Donald Trump,don't know the man never heard of him \u201dYour jaw has to drop at the utter absurdity of any Republican saying such a thing,\u201d At one time maybe, but not anymore. Disingenuousness and duplicity is what I expect from Republican \u201cleaders\u201d. I just assume if they\u2019re talking, they\u2019re not being forthright. Republicans are psychopaths?? My god! I also discovered today that my trash can lid opens when I step on the pedal at the bottom. Who knew?? The GOP is behaving exactly as predicted. Never ever let them forget they were all in on the Trump Train from 2016-2020 and caused this mess. Welcome to 2020 where asking if our elected leaders are actually psychopaths is a completely reasonable headline. Answer:  perhaps, but mostly they are fascists. Let them play pretend. When the time comes and thier seats are up for grabs, we have endless content saved on the internet to absolutely destroy them and very little editing is needed. They did this to themselves. Now that they are laid bare and to waste, Democratic infighting will become the new norm and they will attack their own. It is the nature of how our government works and the power of the flow money. This is classic GOP tactics, we should all prepare for it and prepare to say fuck you. Yes most politicians have thought disorders Yes. They are actually psychopaths. Bad faith actors all around. Not psychopaths. Sociopaths. Every single one.  They don't care about anyone other than themselves.  Fine with taking from others, but touch what they have and they cry foul. It's going to take a long time for government in the US to recover from the damage done by Donald Trump. He so lowered the bar with his abusive, ignorant and trolling behaviour that some will take a while to realize that it isn't, in fact, the \"new norm\" but rather a momentary laps of humanity in the history of the nation. Unfortunately, yes they are. Republicans broke faith in order to prevent their own people from voting for our against a completely qualified judge for Supreme Court. They broke faith to give $4 trillion to their wealthy donors. They broke faith to stop...500 bills I think, that have been passed by the House, so they can avoid questions about why they aren't helping their own citizens survive a literal plague. Democrats want to break faith to help small businesses survive COVID. They want to provide health care for Americans. They want to get children out of cages. Fuck Republican hand wringing. They don't even deserve the ink that's wasted telling us about their crocodile tears. Fuck them and fuck their feelings. Oops we didn\u2019t get 4 more years to lock this shit in, can we be friends while we work on other ways to subvert democracy? They have no other play and their base literally believes anything. DNC needs to move forward with their agenda and stop worrying about being bipartisan. There is a lot of work to do and it's time to stop fucking around. Can you blame them when their supporters and the general public find it perfectly acceptable in the blind ignorance? Mainstream media is also complicit by never following up with the hypocrisy. Y\u2019all muthfuckas really gonna take info from a place named salon.com lmao. \"No\" How can this be a surprise? They play these games because they work. Democrats buckle to these demands because they don't fight back. And many centrist democrat voters want norms and civility, and will balk at their reps playing dirty. Republican voters LOVE when their politicians play dirty and are hypocrites. Just change this sub to \u201cDemocrats\u201d lmao Sociopathic, I believe, would be the most accurate way to describe most of them. It's crazy that people are surprised... I'm 32 so I've I've seen the same shit with Clinton, Bush, Obama, and trump. Both sides do the same shit every time... What about the past 4 years of collusion allegations? Labeling an entire political group as psychopaths and fascists is dangerous. You\u2019re acting like a literal fascist trying to intimidate and control the population for their political views. This tribal mindset of \u201crepublican bad\u201d or \u201cdemocrat bad\u201d is going to be the spark of a literal civil war. You guys think it\u2019s appropriate to demonize half of your country as fascists but then act like fascists using manipulation and intimidation tactics to scare the youth into falling in line with your  That\u2019s all you\u2019ve turned into. Political gangsters set banging on the internet. Yes. For fucks sake. Stop being surprised by it. I don't understand how anyone supports them. It\u2019s crazy to me - Rick Santorum on CNN was saying how the republicans must hold the senate to ensure a bipartisan government. Give me a fucking break. The republicans haven\u2019t been bipartisan for decades. Fuck them and fuck their horse shit policies and corruption. 2-faced shits now see that the shoe is on the other foot and will suddenly become sanctimonious in their rhetoric again. How hypocritical! These articles are such a waste of time. Focus on the psychology of citizens that voted Republican. Figure out why they\u2019re behaving the way they are, propose a solution, and act on it.  the conversation Americans need to have. Apparently Gulianni is gonna be in Michigan today with some \"groundbreaking\" evidence. Psychopath is an understatement! Translation: We were temporarily set back in our attempt to usurp American democracy. Everyone put your mask back on and pretend to care about things until we can try again. Republicans complaining about stimulus checks...bro, we\u2019re returning tax dollars to the tax payers.  Isn\u2019t that one of your basic tenets? They have no morals and no scruples other than winning. That's what makes them so dangerous; old school Democrats are fighting by Queensbury rules and Republicans are trying to gouge his eyes out with his thumbs, Game of Thrones style, and then beat his head in with a baseball bat. These people are fucking dangerous and I hope and pray the Democrats bring their own spiked bat in 2021. Otherwise, it won't be pretty. Decorum is currently dead, cremated, and the ashes scattered. Who knows if it will ever come back. If Republicans hold control of the Senate after the two January runoffs in Georgia, President-elect Joe Biden's nomination of veteran Democratic policy wonk Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget may be in serious trouble. It's not her credentials that are at issue as much as her tweets. No, she didn't call anyone \"scum\" or a \"lowlife dummy\" or an \"enemy of the people.\" That was President Donald Trump. Still, Tanden \u2014 a onetime aide to Hillary Clinton and currently president of a center-left think tank, the Center for American Progress \u2014 has a history of blasting out strident partisan commentary. Republican feelings evidently remain bruised. \"I think, in light of her combative and insulting comments about many members of the Senate, mainly on our side of the aisle, that it creates certainly a problematic path. \u2026 Maybe his worst nominee so far,\" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota called Tanden \"a partisan activist who\u2019s gone after senators of the majority party. She seems to have chosen a path that doesn\u2019t lead to a Senate confirmed office.\" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas ripped her as \"a partisan hack\" who had called Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, \"the worst.\" [Collins, true to form, was noncommittal on Tanden: \"I've heard that she's a very prolific user of Twitter \u2026 I really don't have anything further to say.\"] Conservatives have no virtues, so they can freely flipflop their virtue signaling to align with whatever manufactured reality their team is promoting, at any time. When we get to a Star Trek-like utopian future, there will still be people protesting outside Federation headquarters because they think warp speed travel makes people gay. And when Biden\u2019s in office, they\u2019ll blame all of Trumps tomfoolery on him. China and Russia are enjoying this shitshow of a political mess. If the GOP survives the next 4 years then America deserves its fate. It\u2019s unbelievable we can live in the age of information and still act/believe like braindead cavemen. They want civility?  \"Civility\" includes abiding by rule of law, prosecuting those guilty of defrauding US citizens, enabling a global fascist movement, etc., calling it [anything else]. Yeah, we'll be CIVIL.  We will prosecute and convict those guilty of collecting and spending public funds, while using disinformation to gain political control.  FRAUD, for starters, and to reclaim any possible ill-gotten gains, RICO.  I think we can show conspiracy (talking-points memos for starters) and profiteering. Screw them, screw them one and all. It's not helpful to frame Republicans as crazy. Or frightened, or anything else. It is a political calculation. They held support for trump until the moment they needed to change. They will do whatever is necessary at the moment. Republicans have been packing the courts, gerrymandering districts across the country, suppressing the vote everywhere, and tried to steal an election. They didn't do all this by accident or because they are insane. To think that is to greatly underestimate their motivation and ability. While I generally agree with what you are saying, I don't think we can rule out that they are crazy. Their constant focus on short-term political gains has cost everyone (Republican and Democrat) greatly. Maybe it's semantics, but there has to be some level of crazy to the GOP, given their mind bending levels of hypocrisy and complete disregard for their own purported \"values\", willingness to literally worship Trump.  At some point political calculation and crazy smash into eachother. Underrated comment. They\u2019re smart, calculated people. /shrug It's not helpful to frame Republicans as crazy. Or frightened, Republicans are frightened of sparring off against Trump. Also, when people call them crazy, they don't mean stupid crazy but corrupt crazy. or anything else They're immoral and corrupt. I feel this is an apt criticism that is also true. Crazy does not equal psychopath. Psychopaths know what they are doing. Is is marked by an apathy toward others affective states. I frame them as Traitors to our Republic which through their actions has been Proven. They're the most Anti-American party in the world. ", "Politics"], "Topic": "Politics"},
{"In the media, women politicians are often stereotyped as consensus building and willing to work across party lines. However, a new study found that women in the US tend to be more hostile than men towards their political rivals and have stronger partisan identities.": ["What I take away from this is that media likes to portray US politics as much more functional and reasonable than it is. And this study is only relegated to US politics - which is barely functional as is. The media portrays politics as functional.  Seriously? What media likes to do is keep the \"Women are Wonderful\" myth alive, because it's profitable. I can barely listen to NPR anymore because that's all it seems to do. The weekend shows had been a tradition my whole life I think US politics is working about as it was designed. We have a system where it's only possible to do 'big things' when a majority of the country is behind you for a long enough time.   But, our country is about evenly split -- in the last election, about half of the people voted for Trump and about half of the people voted against him, and the House and Senate are about balanced.   In that environment, there can be no big changes.  Instead, we have to wait for the country to make up its collective mind about which way it wants to head. That may change in 2022, when 22 Senate seats held by Republicans will be up for grabs in the election (only 12 for Democrats). Esp. female politicians, correct? from the article: \u201cWomen are   affectively polarized than men, meaning that there is a larger difference between women\u2019s feelings towards their political party and their feelings towards the other political party,\u201d Ondercin told PsyPost. ... The findings, which have been published in the journal American Politics Research, indicate that  Because   it is. Well yea that is not surprising. Women have stronger attitudes about their own bodily autonomy? Shocking. Ya... I didn\u2019t need to read the article to figure this out. If one party is trying to tell you what you can and can\u2019t do with your body, you\u2019ll probably have strong partisan feelings. Sounds reasonable to me. So, nothing to see here? Misleading title - while it specifies \u2018women politicians\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019 in separate, accurate statements, it implies women politicians are representative of women voters, rather than a self-selected separate group I interpreted both sentences as referring to \"women politicias\" at first Women politicians and women voters aren\u2019t separate (unique) groups. Women politicians are a subset of women voters. What the headline is trying to say, which I do think it a fairly accurate headline \u2014 is that while people (generally) might think of / see women politicians as being consensus builders, those very same women (politicians) are a subset of a much larger group (all women), who tend to be more partisan than men (generally speaking). The post title is from the linked academic press release here: New research suggests there is a gender gap in affective polarization: Women in the United States tend to be more hostile than men towards their political rivals. The findings, which have been published in the journal American Politics Research, indicate that this gender gap is related to women\u2019s stronger partisan identities and stronger attitudes about abortion. \u201cIn the media, women politicians are often stereotyped as consensus building and willing to work across party lines,\u201d said study author Heather Louise Ondercin (@HeatherOndercin), an assistant professor at Appalachian State University. The source journal article is here: You\u2019ve Lost That Loving Feeling: How Gender Shapes Affective Polarization Heather Louise Ondercin, Mary Kate Lizotte American Politics Research First Published November 18, 2020 IF:  DOI:  Abstract We examine variation in levels of affective polarization for men and women. Using the 1980 to 2016 American National Election Studies, we find that women are more affectively polarized than men. The effect of sex partially works indirectly through political identities and issue positions. Moreover, sex acts as a moderator, with political identities and issues positions have different effects on men\u2019s and women\u2019s level of affective polarization. Three factors create women\u2019s higher levels of affective polarization: women are more likely to be partisans, strength in abortion attitudes, and partisanship has a more substantial influence on women\u2019s attitudes compared to men\u2019s attitudes. Breaking the analysis apart into three time periods: (1) gender gap emergence 1980 to 1988, (2) elite polarization 1990 to 1998, and (3) hyper-partisanship 2000 to 2016 reinforces that partisan strength is central to understanding affective polarization. Additionally, during the 1990s when elite polarization is intensifying the strength of issue attitudes and ideology. It's interesting, I remember an historical article from a while back that made a case of female rulers being more prone to go to war over make rulers. I'd like to find that again, though don't have the time atm. It specifically points to abortion, which obviously effects women more. It wonder if women would be as partisan is abortion wasn't such a hot button issue. How much of this can be attributed to a \"new blood\" kind of effect? Government in the US has long been a \"good old boys\" club, and the old men usually see each other as colleagues even across party lines. But most women, especially as of late, get elected on platforms of upheaval, and more recent examples of freshman congresswomen have shown much stronger commitments to ideological goals than their tenured male counterparts who have historically shown to be more concerned with baby-step politicking. It's only natural that an ideologically driven newcomer is going to be much more hostile, or at least less cordial, to their strict ideological opponents,   in specific cases like Congresswoman Oscario Cortez and \"the Squad\", who have been held up by their opposition as the literal devil. There's more than one new congresswoman in that position, and there's some obvious circumstances on the part of their opposition that is going to drive a stronger stance. Well that, and more liberal areas are way more likely to elect women. So you get more liberal/left leaders from more liberal areas. There is evidence that the aggression is not unique to modern us politics. As another poster linked regarding kings vs queens. the title is confusing but the second statement is about all women in the US, not just women politicians. So, do we always need to provide an interpretation can't we just accept what the data says? This poor sub. Gets used and abused for reddits political theater purposes Always has been I just recall how during a debate Warren claimed Sanders made some horrible, rapey sexist remarks. He denied it, said he never said anything like it - and immediately afterwards, as they were leaving the scene, she confronted him for \"making her look like a liar.\" So her making him look like a creep was okay? Warren is a \"See You Next Tuesday\" Do we have good evidence that women politicians are often stereotyped as consensus building and willing to work across party lines? That's not my impression at all. The only woman politician I can think of stereotyped as such is Angela Merkel, and that's because she _is_ a consensus builder willing to work across party lines. Not how Margaret Thatcher was stereotyped. Or Hillary Clinton. Or Nicola Sturgeon. Or AOC. Or Nancy Pelosi. Or Jacinda Ahern. Or Indira Gandhi etc. I suppose there is a claim that is sometimes made that if there were more women politicians we'd have less war or what have you, but it evaporates as soon as you look at how actual women politicians are treated by the media (and indeed the behaviour of women politicians). Edit: correct spelling of Gandhi. I think that the point was that people thought that female politicians where in general less hostile. Thank you. The actual title of the article is much better than OP's. Susan Collins (and Olympia Snowe before she retired) is seen as a moderate or consensus builder. So are Lisa Murkowski and Jeanne Shaheen to a lesser extent. In a gentle way, you can shake the world. Just so you know, the correct spelling is  . When does the media portray female politicians in the US as consensus building? What I get out of this is that we need to stop stereotyping everyone. Men are X, women are Y. It's nonsense. Everyone is an individual.   women are cooperative and willing to collaborate, some other women are highly competitive and individualistic. We have to stop with this notion that you can predict a person's behavior or beliefs by their identity. It can be interesting to look for discrepancies, but the conclusions should not be taken as proof of some underlying biological difference between men and women. They are most likely just a reflection of social prejudices and stereotypes unless proven otherwise. This actually makes sense to me. Women, in general, have to work harder for recognition. For politics, it seems like the consequence of this would be to double down on the party line to prove themselves. The problem is, the study says   about female politicians. It's about female  . The link to the politicians is made by the study's author, but nothing in the study itself singles them out. Women are slightly more affectively polarized than men, meaning that there is a larger difference between women\u2019s feelings towards their political party and their feelings towards the other political party That   are   more affectively polarized is a very different conclusion than what the headline implies. It's not about politicians, as far as I can tell, it's just the general populace. Also, only the women with the strongest opinions will find that struggle worth it. If your opinions are more moderate, you might lose your energy and drop out around the one hundredth time someone tells you to go back to the kitchen. Often enough though, that's sadly still true in perception even if it isn't so much in reality... - and then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's a well-known effect with the same roots as the effect that members of groups for which a stereotype exists that they are bad a certain task are aware of that stereotype and worry about it - which means both that they use cognitive effort on this that could be used for the tasks at hand, and that their actions and reactions are biased by this perception. It's over-correcting for perceived insufficiencies - a widespread tendency. In such situations, even non-biased surroundings don't make that go away immediately (or at all, if the cognitive habits are sufficiently fixed) - though as always, building a more welcoming environment for everyone is incredibly helpful and a very worthy goal for all of us everywhere. \u201cWomen, in general, have to work harder for recognition\u201d Imagine saying that in the age of the \u201cFemale Creator spotlight\u201d Women, in general, have to work harder for recognition Why do you say that? Do women have to work harder for recognition in politics? Is that merely narrative, or is it proven? Because i've seen some studies that show being a woman is an advantage in politics, including the one with gender-flipped trump and clinton. \"Many were shocked to find that they couldn\u2019t seem to find in Jonathan Gordon what they had admired in Hillary Clinton\u2014or that Brenda King\u2019s clever tactics seemed to shine in moments where they\u2019d remembered Donald Trump flailing or lashing out. For those Clinton voters trying to make sense of the loss, it was by turns bewildering and instructive, raising as many questions about gender performance and effects of sexism as it answered.\" I.E, if Clinton was a man, many clinton voters would no longer be able to say what they liked about her. Meanwhile, they'd view Trump as smart and clever and so on if he was a woman. Does that sound like women are disadvantaged in politics? Incidentally: \"We heard a lot of \u201cnow I understand how this happened\u201d\u2014meaning how Trump won the election. \". (I.E, the Democrats involved were suddenly cognizant of how, if you aren't a pro-woman or anti-male sexist like them, Trump was the preferable candidate and a likable character. \"The simplicity of Trump\u2019s message became easier for people to hear when it was coming from a woman\u2014that was a theme. One person said, \u201cI\u2019m just so struck by how precise Trump\u2019s technique is.\u201d\" ). This seems like the opposite of a disadvantage. It seems like anti-male bias in politics. That makes sense. plus, many \"party line\" positions uniquely affect women. Women are politically polarized because apparently, politics is what determines our basic human rights. I'm not sure if the majority of american female politicians are left-leaning, but if so, many of their \"political rivals\" would be in favor of restricting their reproductive freedoms. That sounds like a good reason to be hostile. Wait, so women are people too? With unique and individual characteristics? I'll be damned. I was going to ask: \"how does this relate to science?\" And then I learned about social science. I hate politics but I accept its an important part of daily life Social science pretends to be science, and yet I think we should come up with a better word for it that places it in a separate category of knowledge. Proper experimentation in social sciences, as in double blinded experiments with one variable and a control group, are essentially impossible without violating human rights. Doesn\u2019t make social science an invalid field, but it should not be put in the same category of mathematical predictability as physics. This is hardly surprising. If many have the opinion that women will compromise and work with you in politics it will lead to more people attempting to take advantage of that. The only women politicians that will survive are therefore the one that don't compromise and fight back when someone tries to take advantage of the stereotype. The conclusions are based on feelings towards the opposite political party. I'd like to see if a group of polarized women is more or less likely to come to a consensus than a group of polarized men for a more humanized follow-up study. You get what you pay for. US voters are electing hostile, partisan, candidates and refusing to elect consensus building compromisers.  Gender doesn't matter to this equation because we are not taking random women and putting them in power - we are picking out the ones who spit venom and then observing that a lot of female politicians are vipers.  No surprise there. Note: the natural rebuttal to my point above is Joe Biden - who is very much a consensus builder and compromiser, and he just won a major election.  All of that is true.  I would however argue that his win was born out of a very unique set of circumstances where the Democrats had just come out of losing an election they thought it was impossible for them to lose, and were facing the prospect of 4 more years of Donald Trump who they viewed (whether correctly or incorrectly) as the worst possible human being who could be President, and their choice of Biden was designed to play it safe.  Against any one other than Trump, and in any situation other than having already lost to Trump once in shocking fashion, the Democrats would have nominated someone much more partisan and hostile. The difference between the presidential and congressional election results indicate that votes for Biden were better described as votes against Trump (with plenty of Republicans speaking out against Trump even) US voters are electing hostile, partisan, candidates and refusing to elect consensus building compromisers. It would seem based on some of the comments in this thread that US voters do this because they themselves are hostile partisans with no interest in compromise.  I think the election of Donald Trump represents a fundamental change in the political zeitgeist of America.  Republicans signaled under Obama that they were no longer interested in working across the aisle, and Democrats responded to 2016 by agreeing that they were no longer interested either.  I don't think that's going to change for either party any time soon.  In fact I assume the divide will only get wider from here, with increasingly partisan members of both parties replacing the older moderate members for years to come. Was Obama a hostile, partisan, candidate? Women are more likely to have in-group bias than men. I think that study was posted here as well. It's likely an evolutionary trait. Politicians have different incentives and context than regular people. It's also possible to feel strongly and still be a good collaborator -- even if you still push for what you want, being good at communication can forge commonality. As always, the headline isn't what the study means. Arguably totally irrelevant, and definitely drawing novel conclusions not supported by the study. For the record: Neither politicians nor media portrayals of them were studied. Only asking women (not specifically politicians) to respond to prompts about their attitude toward issues and partisan identity. Anybody who has ever thought that women are more peaceful conciliatory has never spent a lot of time around women. There's a very good reason why a classical Republican system had citizenship tied to military service. How much of this is due to cross-gender versus same-gender interactions? It's easier for men in the mostly-male Congress to reach across the aisle because to them it is business as usual - have lunch, play golf, go to the gym. For women, who don't have that extra thing in common with most colleagues, other forms of commonality - like political party - are  stronger. Off topic but I don't know if going to the gym is a good example. About half the gym goers I see are women, maybe a little less. They probably make up half the fitness influence on socail media, maybe a bit more and probably receiving much more attention (to be fair probably for the wrong reasons for what it's worth). But I don't think the gym is really a male activity these days. I wonder if you could compare this to women being more religious than men. Maybe women are just more rigid in their ideologies in general. I\u2019m would like to see Republican men compared to Democratic women, because I\u2019d bet my bottom dollar that US party identity is a bigger determining factor than sex in politicians This study is about the media lying I guess this is a more philosophical/political than a data driven question, but is 'being willing to work across party lines' necessarily a positive trait? I'm aware this is not what the study is asking, but it does make me wonder. In general, it is. In an ideal world, politicians would work having their own beliefs in front (representing those that voted for them) and having the nations best interest in front. But not \"working across party lines\" means to not be able to work with the other party(s) when their objectives align with your own beliefs, or just not doing it because improving the nation (under the other party's rule) would mean a \"victory\" of their side, implying a \"loss\" of your own party. As a consequence, you loss the ideal representation a politician should replicate while simultaneously the nation's best interest is damaged because parties will not collaborate. Ruling in democracy means to reach agreements, middle points between the different groups, opinions, morals. When people stop talking between each other, the next best way to get your point across is through violence. Yes. Being able to work across party lines shows an ability to look at the issues, not the party, to compromise and generally behave like a reasonable adult. but is 'being willing to work across party lines' necessarily a positive trait? not when only one side is ever expected to do it.  that just means the overton window is doomed to shift toward the side that is never expected to compromise Regardless of the quality of the science here, it would be sufficient to be of interest if it only highlights a common misapprehension. It doesn\u2019t have to say whether the trait is good or bad. When both sides act in good faith, yes. There are women in US speaking against abortion rights, saying women should not vote, saying women should stay at home and be obedient to their husbands. Adult women, born less than 50 years ago. It\u2019s not surprising that this was the find. I mean one of the reasons it took suffrage so long to happen in the US is that the movement was also tied to prohibition Seems like people who were at one point deprived of human rights and equality for decades, while having their rights currently threatened, would be have stronger political convictions. Also this entire thread is just people saying: 'oh no surprises, like gender stereotypes are always accurate. IMO its a misleading correlational study that I'd like to see actually verified instead of jumping the gun. Obvious question is why? I think itll likely be sociological, ideological or what have you rather than any inherent part of the \"female mind\" or whatever. American women have strong opinions? Who knew. Probably because women have far more to lose in politics than men. It makes sense when one party has been attacking women's rights for decades. There is no need to pull punches when people are trampling your individual freedoms. It's almost like the party/policy divisions are more stark for women's issues or something... White women in particular have always been held in high esteem regarding their \"progressive\" political and social values. Kathleen M. Blee, a professor of sociology, aware of that stereotype, decided to explore its veracity. What she discovered was that white women, especially in the 1920s, were a formative block in aiding the KKK, which reached its most powerful and numerous in that same decade. \"Women of the Klan\" is a great book that attempts to determine how \"progressive\" and \"socially unifying\" white women are in society. They have more to lose. More to fight for. All you need to do is look at Waters, AOC, Omar, Pelosi, Harris.  That will tell you all you need to know. ", "Science"], "Topic": "Science"},
{"Scientists have successfully edited SIV \u2013 a virus closely related to HIV, the cause of AIDS \u2013 from the genomes of non-human primates using CRISPR. The breakthrough brings us closer than ever to developing a cure for human HIV infection.": ["The post title is from the linked academic press release here: Taking a major step forward in HIV research, scientists at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University have successfully edited SIV \u2013 a virus closely related to HIV, the cause of AIDS \u2013 from the genomes of non-human primates. The breakthrough brings Temple researchers and their collaborators closer than ever to developing a cure for human HIV infection. The source journal article is here: Mancuso, P., Chen, C., Kaminski, R. et al. CRISPR based editing of SIV proviral DNA in ART treated non-human primates. Nature Communications volume 11, 6065 (27 Nov 2020). DOI:  Abstract Elimination of HIV DNA from infected individuals remains a challenge in medicine. Here, we demonstrate that intravenous inoculation of SIV-infected macaques, a well-accepted non-human primate model of HIV infection, with adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing construct designed for eliminating proviral SIV DNA, leads to broad distribution of editing molecules and precise cleavage and removal of fragments of the integrated proviral DNA from the genome of infected blood cells and tissues known to be viral reservoirs including lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and brain among others. Accordingly, AAV9-CRISPR treatment results in a reduction in the percent of proviral DNA in blood and tissues. These proof-of-concept observations offer a promising step toward the elimination of HIV reservoirs in the clinic. Thank you for this information. Very hopeful for my family member with HIV. It's been controlled for some time now with extremely expensive medicine. But, a cure would be fantastic. Isn't saying human HIV as redundant as saying HIV virus or ATM machine? HIV can go to other primates and undergo small mutations. It's a weird technicality, and it kinda isn't the human virus anymore, but also it kinda is, so they just say Human HIV to assert that it's the human variant, most likely. \"you have been infected with the human human immunodeficiency virus virus\" I hope this is close enough to the topic, but what kind of serious predictions have there been on what a cure for aids would do for low income countries in Africa and Asia? On a similar topic: what other diseases could hope for a cure or better treatment of we manage to cure AIDS? CRISPR-Cas9 is cheap.  It\u2019s a great option, or at least the best we have in terms of genomic therapy. ", "Science"], "Topic": "Science"},
{"Cannabidiol in cannabis does not impair driving, landmark study shows": ["Since there appears to be some confusion,   found that the THC in cannabis   impair driving. However the study was primarily focused on the effects of CBD in cannabis, hence the title. A landmark study on how cannabis affects driving ability has shown that cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis component now widely used for medical purposes, does not impair driving,  . reminder than THC   impair driving, as also found by the study I\u2019m not going to be able to find a right place to post this, so I\u2019ll reply in this comment since it is related to THC impairment: While you   get high/or impaired from CBD in isolation, you   get high from full spectrum CBD products. Particularly if you have a low THC tolerance. Full spectrum CBD products (most oils or pills) have small amount of THC in them. If taken excessively, you can absolutely become high/impaired. I take CBD regularly and there have been numerous times where I\u2019ve gone slightly over my normal dose and gotten high. It\u2019s a thing. It also really sucks ass if you\u2019re taking a higher dose because of bad anxiety and you end up getting high when you weren\u2019t expecting to. CBD on its own, no impairment. Full spectrum CBD, can cause it. It\u2019s not necessarily  , but you definitely can. Edit: Plenty of big time stoners and toke-wizards drying to disprove the verifiable fact that there is THC in Full-Spectrum CBD products. It\u2019s not very hard to figure out. You might want to back to weed school. Wouldn't the difference be in reference for those that take CBD without THC for various medicinal causes, but may still be \"busted\" or what have you for being \"high\"? It\u2019s also been shown numerous times that level of tolerance directly translates to whether THC affects your fine motor skills or spatial awareness. I have a high tolerance and could probably handle driving stoned (never have; never will). But, some don\u2019t have a high tolerance. There\u2019s no way you could make a law to fit all abilities, so the best way to protect the public is to make driving stoned illegal across the board. Now they just need a way to tell because it\u2019s BS to get a DWI/DUI for a joint you smoked a week ago. It does not impair me, i can ride a bike without handle bars and run across mountain trails as well as i would sober. I wonder what the threshold for being \"impaired\" in this study. Studies have shown people under the influence of thc are better drivers than drowsy drivers. They also have the lowest rate of domestic violence. Mild impairment. I bet less than having children in your backseat, or most pharmaceutical drugs for a cold/flu. Okay but so does caffeine, I'm sure getting a sugar high or nicotine withdrawal also impairs driving yet nobody seems to care since those are legal. CBD doesn't impair you, THC does. Yeah, I thought this was common knowledge by now. I'm worried people scrolling through without clicking the article will think smoking and driving is fine... It\u2019s also important that THC only impairs you for a few hours. It does not impair you the next day when you can be tested and it can be found in your system. It doesn\u2019t work the same as alcohol and the current testing in inadequate. Current testing does not test if a driver is impaired rather just if they have used in the past ~48 hours. That means having it in your system does not equal driving under the influence. Yeah but people are gonna turn this into \"see! Weed doesnt impair driving!\" Fun fact, there are two types of psychoactive THC, delta-8 THC and delta-9THC. Delta-8 is considered less psychoactive and until recently was not scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act (Source; does work at a cannabis lab) This is obviously true, but happy to see actual studies coming out confirming it. CBD can help a lot of people without the side effects of other drugs, but the stigma around it has to change first. Yea it does \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Not according to the study by the definitely-not-biased science guy who looks like he woke up on a stranger\u2019s couch this morning. Why are people so desperate to glorify weed as some super-drug that you could do any normal activities on while simultaneously enjoying the mind altering effects. Pick one or the other. You can\u2019t have it both ways. Don\u2019t smoke and drive. It\u2019s pretty simple. The people conducting this study haven\u2019t rode with me stoned (which I don\u2019t do anymore) it wasn\u2019t great. Idk had some cbd and went to grocery store and definitely noticed I was worse. Different for everyone I guess but that was a first/last for me. Also, even if THC doesn't impair you, I don't think you could concentrate very well, at least only on driving, which is what would mess me up. I live in Canada, I personally wont take CBD while driving, it will cause a false positive for THC. A lot of people can drive perfectly fine while high, but I would end up in a fourteen car pile up if I were to get behind the wheel like that. Especially now since I don\u2019t smoke anymore. The extent to which THC can impair you is understated. According to my Gran Turismo 6 times, THC doesn't either. I feel like I have to constantly remind people of this Yeah, for people who don\u2019t understand, this could be a misleading headlining Said someone who's probably never smoked weed... Many study's have shown it doesn't impair driving significantly. Unless the user uses way to much. It should be based on how well you are driving, not on weather or not you smoked. This has to be one of the most socially irresponsible headlines I have ever seen. Yeah I was going with... Some early starting edibles got me into ... non.. optimal situations... The landmark study also makes the distinction  while CBD does not impair driving, THC does: A landmark study on how cannabis affects driving ability has shown that cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis component now widely used for medical purposes, does not impair driving, while moderate amounts of the main intoxicating component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produce mild driving impairment lasting up to four hours. while moderate amounts of the main intoxicating component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produce mild driving impairment lasting up to four hours. but in many states it means you're guilty of DUI for the next 4  ! I\u2019ve read studies that thc does impair driving; however, not as significantly for most people when compared to alcohol (also depends on everyday usage vs one time). The major impairment found was that thc drivers drove slower. There is a threshold of highness though that does impair driving skill. Though I think it was best described as smoking a joint to one self then immediately driving. I think driving high should be a ticket and not a full blown DUI, I think the risk of driving under thc is significantly less than driving under the influence of alcohol and it has been backed up by studies. Though I doubt this will happen until there is a way to accurately test thc impairment while driving. They are getting ready to publish results from a similar study that took place at the University of Colorado (Boulder Campus). I was really thrilled to be a participant in it! I had an initial intake appt at which they did a lot of memory, reflex, strength, balance type tests, did a complete interview about the products I consume (both Rx and not) and how much I drink. I then had to submit to bloodwork and urinalysis. I left with a ticket to pick up my randomly assigned \"strain\" (Cannabis concentrate, all high CBD but varying degrees of THC content). I was asked to abstain from ALL cannabis for a few days, and then to consuome only the test strain for the 3 days leading up to my next test. They arrived at my house in a totally inconspicuous white van (I so wanted tie-dye, missed opportunity) and put me through all of the same testing that took place at the original appointment. Drew my blood, and then sent me into my house to consume \"however much I usually would\". They repeated each round of tests immediately, and then I believe 60 minutes later. A lot of remembering lists (I am clearly not as smart as Trunk, because I kept forgetting my list), and reflex based tests timing my response time with both hands and feet, lifting my foot when I felt a tap, etc. I was excited to be a part of the collection of real data regarding how impaired, or not impaired you are, by cannabis or cbd. In the US we have implemented a system of regulations based on our understanding of alcohol impairment and metabolism. Because the govt put a kabash on research into Marijuana for so long, we are just way behind in knowledge. I am a daily cannabis user. I want to do that responsibly. I also sat on the jury for a \"DWI\" under THC trial. THat was one crazy show to watch. We need some good science on levels of impairment, time after consumption, etc. It was the most ridiculous 3 hours of showboating on the part of the various labs and the lawyers for both sides. That's fascinating, thank you for sharing! I'm not sure if it's the same study or not but I got turned away from a study at cu Boulder for pot  that I was stoked to be in. Oh well. Any chance you could elaborate on the dwi on thc case without putting anyone in trouble? I'm genuinely curious how those go in CO. I sat on a dwi for alcohol case a few years ago but that seemed pretty tame and just amounted to an argument over the process of field sobriety with refusing to take a breathalyzer and wanting blood drawn or something. I forget the details \u201cFindings  In this crossover clinical trial that included 26 healthy participants who underwent on-road driving tests, the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP, a measure of lane weaving, swerving, and overcorrecting) at 40 to 100 minutes following vaporized consumption was 18.21 cm for CBD-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm for THC-dominant cannabis, 21.09 cm for THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and was 18.26 cm for placebo. At 240 to 300 minutes, the SDLP was 19.03 cm for CBD-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm for THC-dominant cannabis, 19.88 cm for THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and 19.37 cm for placebo. Compared with placebo, SDLP with THC-dominant and THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis was significantly greater at 40 to 100 minutes but not 240 to 300 minutes after consumption; there were no significant differences between CBD-dominant cannabis and placebo.\u201d 26 participants and a difference of a centimeter or two between the groups. For reference, highway lanes in my state are about 400cm wide. Where is the control group? Why did the CBD-only group outperform the placebo group? Why is a 26 person study getting this much publicity without ANYONE in the comments mentioning these data? It's a crossover study, they test the same pt on each of the drugs, they are their own control. And the results weren't statistically significant with the CBD group, so there was actually no difference and it didn't outperform controls. But that's fine, we wouldn't expect them the be different. Overall It's that same issue we see all the time with journalism, it gets misinterpreted and overblown. Need more data, but this is a good start. Thank you. CBD has no effect on driving, and(!!) It is extremely important to note that there is no test that indicates 'x' amount of THC in the blood equals a specific amount of impairment. The amount in the blood is entirely dictated on the frequency of use, and is not associated directly with any impairment. For instance, a regular user can test over the legal limits in the State of Washington after not using cannabis for days. They literally just made up a number and ran with it. Tickets for cannabis impairment based on blood quanta should be viewed as voodoo.  This. The government said it to itself in the NHTSA's report to Congress in 2017:  Read page 11, especially the last sentence, \"[This research] does not  show a relationship between THC levels and impairment.\" Full stop. Yeah, tolerance is a massive factor... A daily heavy smoker will be perfectly fine and coordinated and responsive at a dose that would put a normal person into couch lock. For instance, a regular user can test over the legal limits in the State of Washington after not using cannabis for days. They literally just made up a number and ran with it. Because of this, I feel like it would be relatively easy to fight a ticket for cannabis impairment. If THC can be detected in a person's system after not using for days, then there would be no way to legitimately prove   that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the incident. (IANAL) Tickets for cannabis impairment based on blood quanta should be viewed as voodoo. The issue with this approach is that there absolutely needs to be laws against driving while stoned. And for that to happen there needs to be a quantifiable way to check if someone has smoked. Your right, how impaired you are depends on several different factors. How used to the sensation you are, how much chemical tolerance you've built up, your personal reaction to it. But \"But I've got high tolerance\" just cannot be an excuse. It needs to be treated like alcohol, are you stoned at all? That's a DUI. It's the same reason so many people die or get injured from drink-driving. People are poor judges of themselves and instead of accepting that they shouldn't be driving while high or drunk, insist that they are special snowflakes who are totally fine. If I had to drive right this second, I'd not. Like. no. Nope!. I am too high right now. THC's great for non-regimented activities; dancing, yoga, painting, music. Artistic endeavors, where the impairment is intentional in order to foster creativity, to break out of cemented ideas and explore the loose associations generated by overdriven imagination. It turns up the temperature of thought, creates chaos in the mind, and unpredictability. Which diametrically contradicts the principal rule of driving: be  . Maintain speed, keep straight, preconceive each maneuver, eschew spontaneity. The mind must remain on the road, lest it end up on the road. CBD doesn\u2019t impair you no, but this title might mislead some people, anybody whos used cannabis before and has an iq of over 5 would know that marijuana most certainly does impair your driving. Maybe we should stick to driving sober anyways.  10 more years and cars will drive you wherever you want anyways. Elon said this would be happening by 2020, and yet their Tesla's can't even get out of a parking lot. This is an awfully irresponsible and misleading headline. Clinical neuroscience researcher here who specializes in cognitive impairment; let me preface this by saying I am not encouraging \u201cstoned\u201d driving, but from the literature and anecdotal clinical experience, I\u2019m of the belief there are segments of the population who are less \u201cimpaired\u201d when they have THC supplements. We all have an   that is responsible for the processing of cannabinoids (including those produced endogenously or obtained via other means). Unlike say alcohol, which is quite literally metabolized by the body as a toxin, cannabinoids are something our bodies need to function well. THC can and does have medicinal benefits for some people; for some, the supplement will make them healthier/more able. For the majority (non-clinical) populations, it is likely impairing. I\u2019m not doubting the findings of this work, but I\u2019d love to see them investigate before and after THC within the various populations who use cannabis for specific medicinal needs. I believe the future of cannabis science will see specific targeted treatment of deficient cannabinoids in patients, similar to how people need iron or vitamin supplements. Ultimately, I believe that a field sobriety test is of much more value than a blood test in terms of facilitating safe driving. I don\u2019t want anyone too cognitively impaired on the road, whether that\u2019s from age, drugs or sleep deprivation. Edit:  Seems similar to pharmaceutical drugs, many of which advise you not to drive on them until you know how they affect you. I don\u2019t think you necessarily get a DUI for having opiates, benzos, amphetamines in your system, and it\u2019s generally understood that many people drive on such drugs all the time. Definitely more complicated and difficult to measure than booze. Full spec low thc cannabis is medicine. Full stop right there. High THC cannabis also has purpose but come with intoxication. The demonization of cannabis has been extremely detrimental to humanity. It's been used for literally thousands of years, the lower THC higher CBD stuff. Higher THC cannabis came fairly recently, at first with the aid of off-books 'engineers.' There is legit benefit of lower THC high CBD cannabis. If you\u2019re evidently impaired while driving regardless of why, you can be charged. Tiredness included. It\u2019s just a form of reckless driving. If you\u2019re tired but driving fine there\u2019s no crime of course. Meanwhile being tired does and is perfectly legal. Driving while overly tired is actually against the law most places. Driving while being tired is illegal in most places, if not all of the US. Meanwhile being tired does and is perfectly legal. It\u2019s actually not. If a cop pulls you over, and you tell them you\u2019re tired. You\u2019re gonna get in trouble. If you can\u2019t safety drive, regardless of what you\u2019re smoking or drinking or feeling, you\u2019ll get in trouble. Yeah you get DWI\u2019d in Canada if you\u2019re tired, just the same as if you were drunk. EDIT : DWI = Driving While Impaired Meanwhile being tired does and is perfectly legal Please, inform yourself before writing anything online. I believe some states include DUIs for any substance.   So if you were drowsy from antihistamines you could be charged.  But they would have to prove it was from the antihistamines so I guess, don't admit to it taking allergy medicine and just claim you were sleepy. Please make this title more clear to those who think it's the same as THC Isn't this like saying the water in Beer doesn't effect your driving? Yes it is so? You can drink water and drive IIT - People who now think it's now ok to smoke and drive. this is gonna make some selfish idiots think its ok to drive while high If they don\u2019t know the difference between THC and non-psychoactive cannabinoids, which is the topic, maybe. This type of misleading title can lead to actual deaths THC is what impairs. If anything it causes extreme paranoia in drivers. To some extent some may prefer cautious drivers over drunk and erratic drivers. Cannabidiol in cannabis does not impair driving, landmark study shows ...however, lack of sleep, anxiety, anger, fear, high-levels of adrenaline, inability to focus, texting, talking on the phone, arguing with passengers, etc... all   seriously impair driving and there's no major initiatives to curb 90% of those issues. There are though, plenty of states now require you to be hands free. In some states you are required to take your medications to drive if you could be a danger if you came off of it like Siezures, ADHD, Anxiety, etc. Just because you don't see people out in the streets and writing articles about it doesn't mean no one is thinking about it. Is there a major initiative to curb CBD? This study found that THC   impair driving. What? How could there be an initiative against driving with adrenaline? You understand people can\u2019t control that right? There is literally no initiative to stop CBD users from driving, whereas for some of the things you listed (texting while driving, talking on the phone, being overly tired) do have systems out there to stop them There\u2019s no major initiative to treat anxiety, inability to focus, or sleep deprivation??? Being in the phone while driving is already a fat ticket, but how do you suggest \u2018curbing\u2019 the other problems? Should we all have bio-monitors installed checking our adrenal and fear levels?? Think about that kind of stuff before blaming the system. And a ton of pharma drugs impair you as well and they are rarely mentioned for some reason.  $$ As a CBD user this sounds like great news but is the source really without bias? Sometimes if you look hard enough for the data you want you find it. I\u2019m not questioning the methods, just maybe the who and why the study was done. it looks like a reasonably unbiased source as for the why it was done\u2014if CBD-based painkillers are going to be on the market, you need to know if you have to write driving-related notices on the box as for many strong pain killers, etc \u201cThe results should reassure people using CBD-only products that they  are most likely safe to drive, while helping patients using  THC-dominant products to understand the duration of impairment.\u201d It\u2019s an unbiased source. Also worth noting that THC still causes impairment, whilst CBD may not. It\u2019s actually a really important question here in Australia, because while it is now legal to be prescribed cannabis preparations as medical treatment, it is illegal to drive with detectable amounts on random drug testing- ie, if you are prescribed cbd, you cannot legally drive. As such, this is why this study was done, as the implications for users of medicinal cannabis in Australia is significant, and is a major factor in consenting to treatment with these medicines. The sponsor behind that research sounds extremely biased, and if it was a tobacco or alcohol company, instead of a CBD university spin-off, people would be griping about it non-stop. That said the research was not conducted by the biased sponsor but by a different university and published in JAMA so one should hope it's reliable study. It was an article in JAMA, which is about as top tier of a scientific journal you can get.  One aspect that wasn't mentioned is that the dosing seemed pretty low.  It wasn't clear to me if that was the entire dose or not.  Other studies have dosed CBD up to 400 mg and reported slight feelings of intoxication. Although weed affects your driving, comparing it to the effects of alcohol is misguided, and studies have shown impairment can widely vary by tolerance and other factors. I\u2019m impaired right now! I feel like we all knew this, am I wrong? Dr looking a little sus I\u2019m waiting for a study to come out regarding CBG and delta-8-THC ! \ud83e\udd27 Friendly reminder that CBD does literally nothing without THC. Don't smoke and drive. What\u2019s fascinating is that even the THC dominant intoxication had a 2.33cm Standard Deviation of Lane Position (SDLP). The test is calibrated with BAC of 0.05% (legal limit in Australia, having a 2.4cm SDLP. Meaning that being intoxicated with THC dominant cannabis driving 40 mins post inhalation, you are no more dangerous than someone at the legal BAC limit. Hopefully this can inform more commons sense road laws surrounding cannabis consumption. Isn't THC a cannabidiol? Someone is going to read this and think smoking a fat blunt while driving is just fine The amount of people in this thread who don\u2019t know the difference between cannabidiol and THC is a bit concerning Interesting... on another note, perhaps I should do a mini-AMA on the stoned driving study I participated in on behalf of the Canadian government prior to legalization of cannabis in autumn 2018. The Canadian government got us stoned, paid for delivery food, and had us drive an incredibly realistic driving simulator. Good times. *Read the full article - headline should lead with \u201cCBD\u201d since that\u2019s what we\u2019re all used to calling it n=14? \u0391nd people are hyped about this? This isn\u2019t a study, this is clickbait Shoulda stopped the comments at 420 Far too many people will cite this as science proving you can drive while high. Well, yeah. CBD does basically nothing. Who the hell thought it would impair driving? It does nothing and so much at the same time, it's awesome Cannabidiol is CBD, one chemical in cannabis. THC is a different chemical in cannabis and does impair driving. Different strains of cannabis have different amounts of each. And while we're at it, hemp and marijuana are both forms of the cannabis plant, and there are many strains of each. Hemp by definition has very little THC. Marijuana by definition has at least a little THC, sometimes quite a lot. And CBD oils contain no thc. Wow it\u2019s almost like CBD doesn\u2019t do anything at all If you have anxiety, it does a lot. Like a 0.25mg Alprazolam almost for me. Wow it's almost like the world doesn't revolve around your personal experiences alone. It's a proven anti-inflammatory with peer reviewed science showing it to be effective at treating IBD and some types of seizure disorders. There is also evidence of benefit for certain types of chronic pain, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders... I could have told you that.... In another landmark study, hops in beer don't impair driving, the alcohol does Although it was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Australia and the Netherlands did this study.  These types of studies are usually banned in America.  American politicians want full deniability of any knowledge of anything pertaining to marijuana so they can make decisions based purely on polls or morals.  They find facts irritating and distracting and will do a lot to avoid them. They're not banned but because of the federal schedule 1 status it's almost impossible to obtain authorization to conduct medical research because the definition of schedule 1 means that the substance has \"no medical value.\" I believe very select universities have authorization to do research on cannabis and I'm not sure about private entitites The water in beer doesn\u2019t get you drunk These studies need to continue. And impairment needs to be the focus as the current system doesnt work and cannabis will be legalized soon. Its insane people can get in trouble for smoking days or weeks earlier and still be charged because its in their system. Alochol limits exist because there is an understanding between consumption and impairment. Today in overtly misleading headlines. Landmark news: Decaffeinated coffee doesn't keep you up all night! this is a really dangerous article Anyone who has ever taken CBD will tell you it has zero psychoactive effects. It simply helps with a myriad of ailments. I've smoked for years and DO get impaired while driving high, trust! I wouldn't have expected it to... As long as THC is not present it should be fine. This tweet is misleading and may be harmful. I've been smoking pot for 20 years. Being high makes you a MUCH worse driver. Any stoner already knows this I was born in Switzerland, and while regular weed isn't available for sale (the consumption of it is legal on your property I believe), weed that has been specifically bred to have high CBD/low THC content is available even in corner shops now. I believe you're allowed to drive after having smoked CBD weed there. ", "Science"], "Topic": "Science"},
{"No-kill, lab-grown meat to go on sale for first time": ["I remember hearing about 10 years ago it would take like 10 years to bring lab-grown meat to market, and here we are. Fusion Energy in shambles.... It isn't close to markets. It just has approval in singapore. Can't possibly come soon enough.  I'm aaaaaall over it when it becomes available. Impossible Beef is already here and it's identical in taste and texture EDIT: what I have shared here is an  . Like any statement regarding taste is. Chill out everyone Whoa, this is a wild statistic. \"By weight, 60% of the mammals on earth are livestock, 36% are humans and only 4% are wild.\" Damn, that's ridiculous! well that's only mammals. if you extend it to all animals then the wild is much larger - total insects weigh more than total humans. the other thing about it is that mammals we eat are large from their diet, lack of exercise, breeding, and hormones while the mammals that are wild are going to be much smaller - think squirrles, rats, etc. while things like elephants and rhinos are the outliers and there's not many of them. so you'll never see a wild cow but even if you did they likely wouldn't be as large as the domesticate ones. I find that horrifying. Not because of the ethical implications, more of the \u201coh shit we\u2019re almost entirely alone\u201d implications. I wanna try it \ud83d\ude2d Like its not vegan, but it is?? Worth noting that as of yet the lab grown meat isn't vegan because it still requires taking cells from the animals. As far as I'm aware, you still need starter cells, which means even if this becomes prominent it would cut down but not eliminate the need for factory farming. Of course, I say this as someone who simply eats whatever's in the fridge, and doesn't particularly do vegan anyway, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f just letting people know. You're confused about what veganism is. The fact that the cells come from animals don't make it non-vegan. Veganism is a philosophy centered against animal cruelty and exploitation. \"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude\u2014as far as is possible and practicable\u2014all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.\" The biggest hurdle cell grown meat has for veganism is animal serum, so far a lot of these cultures use animal serum to grow cells whereas some labs are already developing plant-based ones. \"The clean meat industry is racing to ditch its reliance on foetal blood\" But once you have those cells can\u2019t you take the cells from the lab meat and therefore no animals was harmed in the making of the second batch. Besides this isn\u2019t for the vegan looking to eat meat market. This is for the meat eater who gave up meat but didn\u2019t want to because of its cost or detriment to the environment. No meat substitute product is marketed for a vegan or vegetarian. It\u2019s marketed for someone who eats a lot of meat to replace a new or two a week Well not necessarily. From 1 biopsy you would produce a master cell stock in a large volume( e.g. 50.000 ltrs) and store it in very little vials. And from each of these vials you would be able to produce working cell stocks in the same manner. And these working cell stocks might then be used one by one for the production of the meat - meaning that you could run probably 100thousands of cultivations from one biopsy. When you scale up the production vessels high enough for higher meat production per cultivation, this should be a neglectable problem. However, the aspect of not being totally vegan might still stand because at the end the cells were coming at some day from an animal, though you cannot really state that it was severely harmed. I mean, I guess. But you\u2019d be improving our meat productivity by, like, several orders of magnitude. And with such astronomical productivity gains, you eliminate the need for such vicious, high-throughput factory farming. Animals could be provided some semblance of QoL for most of their life. I mean, this would be like 50-75 years into a massive success story, and we\u2019d have to ask what are we gunna do about the massive existing livestock population, but idk. But yes, at the beginning of the production chain will still be a commodified animal body, which will be slain. Nothing changing that so far as I can see No, it is vegan. How is it that growing this lab grown meat includes \u201cfoetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood\u201d, and yet this is being promoted as free of animal treatment issues? I hope it reduces animal mistreatment. Cells from one donor cow cultuted in labs rather than a billion cows is like a billionth of the suffering. How is it that growing this lab grown meat includes \u201cfoetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood\u201d, and yet this is being promoted as free of animal treatment issues? People are dumb. its a nothingkilled burger! Fetal cows are killed for this process. Anyone knows what's the CO2 impact of growing meat like that compared to raising animals? edit: Seems CO2 might be worse (but as usual depends on how the energy needed here is produced), Methane better, less water and land needed and in general the numbers are not in yet as this stuff is too new:  For one, researchers assumed humanity wouldn\u2019t decarbonize energy production in that time period\u2014meaning we\u2019d still be burning fossil fuels to power the plants that produce in vitro meat Looking at the impact in 1000 years and assuming that decarbonizing energy production won't happen seem like 2 very weird decisions here. It's a lot easier to decarbonize energy production than to nullify livestock GHG emissions. What if we just like, idk, ate plants instead \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Tastes like chicken ? Could taste like strawberry.  I bet we will see some wild combos in the next decade. On the other hand. Would I enjoy something with a beef texture and fruity taste? Must be weird the first time. Does this address any of the environmental concerns about eating higher up the food chain?  It's not clear from this piece. For those of you saying that it\u2019s not cruelty-free, they say in the article that they take the cells from biopsies of live animals. How is it better for the environment if we have to build factories to produce and process fake meat? Where do all the raw materials come from and how are the sourced? Yeah mate. Just eat plants. People don't like this answer, but it's the most sensible one. It's not cruelty free. It's grown from the blood of baby cow hearts.  Not for much longer. I think all these companies know that the supply of FBS is not enough to sustain large scale production. The cells used to start the process came from a cell bank and did not require the slaughter of a chicken because cells can be taken from biopsies of live animals. The nutrients supplied to the growing cells were all from plants. The growth medium for the Singapore production line includes foetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood, but this is largely removed before consumption. A plant-based serum would be used in the next production line, the company said, but was not available when the Singapore approval process began two years ago. I need a more reliable source than the website you linked before I can decide if it's cruelty free or not. Is it just me or does chicken and beef seem like a waste of this tech? What did a dodo taste like? Or a sea turtle? Or all the other things people ate/are eating to extinction. How about Chinese medicine? Would they accept rhino horn and pangolin scale grown in lab? And I have to imagine someone is pitching creepy billionaires on the idea of lab grown long pig. Imo, get crazy with it later. First, let's stop mass killing billions of animals annually that are repeatedly bred and forced to endure factory farms because are they currently suffering while the others are already gone or \"off limits\". Then create whatever animal the heart, er stomach, desires lol Though I love the idea of moving forward with weird lab grown things used in traditional medicines. In all reality, it's probably a cost thing. More people are likely to buy beef practically continuously rather than occasionally try something exotic once in a while. People like to eat what they grew up with. As for long pig, there's already been a few non-human based renditions, so I'm sure it'll happen lol there was even a guy on reddit who got to take his amputated leg home from the hospital and cook it and eat it with his friends (search on Google and you'll get the thread. Be warned the images are graphic). Apparently we taste yummy which isn't really a surprise imo. It's likely that they need living cells to reproduce, so they can compare the clone cell to the original. Something like that, I'm not a scientist. But it is well documented what the dodo tasted like, general consensus was it wasn't great tasting. It was in the pigeon family, so the taste is likely similar if you wanted to give it a try. The dodo became extinct for alot of reasons, but it being delicious wasn't one of them. It had no natural predators prior to humans and only laid one egg at a time to reproduce, it was doomed the minute the careless hungry sailors set foot on the same land. Most of the things that we've hunted to extinction wasn't because of the irresistible taste, it's our greed. So it's really not worth the work to bring it back just to eat, we need to sort out the problem of factory farming first. Are you a writer? Because you have the outline of a great story right there How about trying human meat if it\u2019s grown in a reactor? Well no, you\u2019re wrong. This technology costs a lot. Billions of animals are getting slaughtered every year for our tastebuds, let\u2019s try and reduce that suffering instead of focusing on turtle and what not that almost nobody eats anyway. Focusing on sea turtle and your other tastebud fantasies would be the waste here. What a bad idea. All ahil Margaret Atwood, Chickynubs are here How much is it? Being completely ignorant of this, are there any downsides to eating this meat compared to regular meat? What does it say about us as a species that only when the most advanced, closest-you-could-get-to-meat option requiring the   amount of personal sacrifice is available will we be willing to change our behavior to make an impact on our planet and the creatures that inhabit it? So is it vegan? Those cells are alive and you are killing them.  I am not against lab grown meat, but its hardly deathless. no-kill [...] The growth medium for the Singapore production line includes foetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood And where do you think that freshly-squeezed calf juice comes from, ya dingus? Do you have a source? I don't see how animal meat can be grown using plant cells because in order to grow the meat because the scientists have to mimic the nutrients and cells of  a womb of an animal for the meat to grow. This is cool but I find as an \"aspiring\" ethical vegetarian the hardest thing to replace is CHEESE.  Which is funny because substitutes are performing technological miracles to mimic the texture and mouthfeel of meat fibers, which seems harder, to me, than a homogenous block of cheese. Why has fake meat come so far but fake cheese still a hard pass? Then go find one if you're not satisfied. \ud83e\udd22 Disgusting, what flavors can they replicate? Pheasant, rabbit, duck?    \ud83d\ude01 What's the macros?! Woo Aww yiss, here we go, it's the start of the future! I won't eat GMO produce, so I'm going to give this shit a wide berth. And this is how we get zombies. Cuz, 2020. Username checks out People should develop a taste for liver, they\u2019d be healthier if they ate more organs and not simply muscle meat. Nah rather have real meat. As long as it doesn't cause an increased percentage of cancer in people that eat this lab-grown meat vs organic meat and tastes at least close to the original then this could be great. No meat is your best bet against cancer. So what exactly are you putting in your body then? Cultivated meat cells. Cue the zombie apocalypse in five, four... For those objecting, we still barely understand protein structure and formation, folding, so synthetically grown material like this could have long term health effects that are unforeseen. For reference, how much do we understand mad cow disease? rabies? Any introduction like this can open the door to contamination of chronic poisoning, maybe if we could figure out how to cure the diseases we already have we could start to synthesize food at this level. Rabies is caused by a Virus, which has nothing to do with growing animal cells. Mad Cow Disease   caused by Prion, but if anything lab grown meat would be safer from the disease. I don\u2019t think you know what\u2019s happening here, \u2018synthesizing\u2019 meat this way is just growing cells, they\u2019re not making new types of meat or protein or some shit. This is great, hope they will be able to bring the price way down though. This doesn't  necessary need to replace the high quality meat, but rather the cheap stuff that's most cruelly and environmentally unfriendly sourced. Vegetarians are divided about this lol. I\u2019m on the side of thinking it\u2019s ethical but yucky and I\u2019m not going to eat it. Some of my friends have been waiting for it so they can eat meat again without the negatives. I think it will be a good thing for the world in general. Nothing has died in the production of this meat. Only them cells tho. If it tastes the same, I'll 100% eat it instead of real chicken bites. I won't be stopping eating roast chicken though. Probably doesn't, since fat carries the taste. I think they are doing only lean meat but I can be wrong. If we can get off fossil fuels and shift meat production to lab-grown that'll put a huge dent in our carbon emissions. We need to have both of these done by 2030. No excuses.

{"U.N. Reclassifies Cannabis as a Less Dangerous Drug": ["Great news. Hopefully a lot of good research comes out of it. It's good and bad. It means the pharmaceutical companies and the FDA are sure to strong arm their way into it. Putting the brave people who fought for the legalization out of business. The most dangerous thing about weed is getting caught with it. I've said this for years, and it's true. But I'm also ready to reclassify this claim when it becomes truly legal everywhere. Once weed is truly legal, I'll be able to say that these are the issues with using it, and discuss responsible use. None of them are as bad as the anti-drug people make them out to be, so the discussion doesn't really get anywhere as long as they're still pulling that shit. But once they finally lose and let it be legal, then we can talk about the issues with using it too early in life, using it chronically, using it in high doses chronically, long term chronic use and other legitimate aspects of use. It's the same as sugar. If sugar was illegal the worst thing about it would be the dangers of getting caught with it. But with sugar legal we can instead talk about the risks of too much. Eating too much can make you fat. Eating sugar can rot your teeth. Even without getting fat, it changes your blood sugar level. That has a cascade effect on your body. Etc. There are legitimate considerations for using sugar. Same with pot. But we can't even discuss things like stunting your emotional maturity because you started smoking daily at 11 because even mentioning this has people thinking you're in the pro-prohibition camp with the zealots. I work as a nurse on a mental health unit, while IMHO, weed is definitely far from the worse, it can still help induce or increase psychotic symptoms or increase depressive symptoms in many people especially if you already have a mental health issue. So if one can chose, you should pick cbd and not thc. However, if you want to get fucked up in your head, have full blown psychosis and meeting people like me, do take meth/amphetamines. This will definitely mess you up way more. (obviously, I'm excluding psychostimulants prescribed by you doctor in proper dosage.) In Canada the most dangerous thing about weed here is to stuff the bag upside down in your pocket and end up with a pocket full of weed and weed full of lint and pocket crumbs. My mom still considers it a gateway drug. And i wish we would just have edibles that way it\u2019s super safe and doesn\u2019t have the harmful lung effects from smoking. Literally put it in snacks and stfu and tax the hell out of it We\u2019re lucky alcohol wasn\u2019t like this because it\u2019s a hell of a lot more deadly and actually kills people Have to quit weed currently because it causes extreme anxiety and my heart rate goes up to 150 bpm at rest every time I smoke. Been a week and I still have anxiety, I feel like my body is in a constant fight or flight response and my chest feels very 'airy' and butterflies in my stomach. It's also difficult to sleep like this. I feel/think like I have extreme health problems and my heart will fail (I turned into hypochondriac) while I consciously know that is totally not true, I am perfectly healthy besides these feelings. This is with very heavy use though, a gram or more daily for years. With that, I think getting caught with it here in NJ is still a lot worse and will fuck up your life way more than anxiety. It also causes chs which is excruciating stomach pain but it is not very common. I probably will smoke again one day but not anytime in the foreseeable future.. The fact that cannabis was on a list of dangerous drugs in the first place is absurd atleast in one category with heroin etc, I mean cmon, its weed Why is the UN classifying drugs in the first place? The UN has 4 main purposes: To keep peace throughout the world To develop friendly relations among nations To help nations work together to improve the lives of poor people, to conquer hunger, disease and illiteracy, and to encourage respect for each other\u2019s rights and freedoms To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve these goals This is the best tl;dr I could make,   reduced by 80%. (I'm a bot) Dec. 2, 2020, 6:11 a.m. ET.A United Nations commission voted on Wednesday to remove cannabis for medical use from a category of the world's most dangerous drugs, such as heroin, a highly anticipated and long-delayed decision that could clear the way for marijuana research and medical use. \"We will have the U.N., the main drug policy body, recognizing the medical usefulness of cannabis,\" he said ahead of the vote. The overhaul of cannabis policy, particularly around legalization for medical use, has moved at a rapid pace over the last few years, said Jessica Steinberg, managing director at the Global C, an international cannabis consulting group, who has attended U.N. meetings.  |   |   |    :          So funny that Weed and Heroin were classed together but Pharmaceutical use of opiates has remained so prevalent and Pot has been so neglected. The schedules described here and NOT the same as the DEA's in the USA. Guys marijuana is really dangerous. If a person smokes 20,000 joints in 15 minutes they can die. Let us not forget to inform all the helicopter parents that it\u2019s not due to weed, it\u2019s due to a lack of oxygen that kills you. Don\u2019t need any parents in here reading this going \u201cmy Danny boy is a super smoker, he probably could smoke that much in 15 minutes\u201d. It\u2019s ridiculous that we have to inform them That 50s \u201cweed kills brain cells\u201d study was done by pumping constant smoke into a gas mask worn by a monkey. It\u2019s easier to OD from \u201ctoo much smoke, not enough air\u201d than \u201ctoo much smoke, too much THC in bloodstream\u201d Challenge accepted Close one. For real it's less dangerous than Advil And even then it\u2019s not the weed that kills you. It\u2019s all that deeeelicious cookie dough Also if you eat a pot brownie you could choke on it and die that way! I\u2019ve heard of lolly popping, but those boys in that picture gave those girls the full high bald fade. Pretty damn early too.  No fluff buds for them I guess? Exactly, far too extreme...and they also lost a month vegging them so big in the first place The fact that entire nations were ok with pretending cannabis was harmful shows you everything you need to know about people in power. About the people that   in power, and the uninformed inertia of public support they mustered decades ago. Some ban-hammer-happy powerful racists make weed super-illegal and convinced a huge section of the public to go along with it. Now I would be surprised if anyone in power   cares about weed, half of them regularly do much more powerful stuff, what they think is that being anti-weed is a vote winner in some circles. As this becomes less and less true and the court of public opinion turns in favor of weed, power will follow. But there's NO way they'd ever use that same tactic with other mediums outside of pot.. /s Just make it legal already. Tired of hiding and smoking Legal in Canada. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Good stuff I UN Thank you for dropping the schedule of marijuana It makes ZERO sense as to why it was in the first place It makes ZERO sense as to why it was in the first place Money and control. Plain and simple. Because Nixon couldn't make being a hippie or a civil rights protester or being black illegal,  Regan ramped the whole thing up to 11 and now we have an entire prison industrial complex to fight against decriminalization of largely harmless plants. America was settled by puritans and that way of life still lingers today! I'm an american in oklahoma and have a medical card! My statement still stands that puritan values still linger today! Read this book, it will explain what happened. Actually it was a very effective way to control people of color and poor economic standing. Look into William Randald Hurst. Capitalism x Bigotry I hope psychedelics will follow Also for these substances, it makes no sense it makes sense if you know the history of it! Obvious.  Weed makes you see.  It removes the anxiety that the overlords impose on you. Because of pressure from the US. I wonder if this is an early sign of the States losing some of its global influence. Getting closer.  Fact is, cannabis is more correctly classified as a useful plant, with an extremely favorable safety profile. Now do psilocybin. Psychedelics in general. But i think its wiser to start with the natural ones (mescaline, dmt and psilocybin) because people they have less stigma and thousands of years of safe use. Shrooms are an amazing drug. Had severe anxiety growing up and high school was the worst. Also had fear of animals and insects. Started experimenting with Psilocybin and pretty much made me stop giving a fuck about being anxious and I pick up lizards and frogs up without freaking out. Though if youre not ready for it, it can be self destructive if you bullshit yourself. Best analogy I heard was \"its like taking a big mental shit, four months of therapy in four hours.\" And do LSD, MDMA, 2C-B, DMT, 4-Aco-DMT, 5-Meo-DMT, mescaline, LSA, ETH-LAD, etc Great, so governments with all their resources are just figuring out what we all knew.  Better late than never I guess. governments [...] just figuring out what we all knew do not mistake corruption for incompetence. Great, so governments with all their resources are just   admitting what we all knew because a business model is in play. Sometimes I like to plagiarize and add a few of my own words. As much as I want to see the new marijuana industry not be dominated by big ag/pharma i cant wait to smoke the super weed monsanto is working on Just...no. Big corps will never do it as well as the small time growers. And that\u2019s a good thing. And yet GA will arrest you for possession of any amount. Mindblowing Iowa is right there with you. Bye-bye boomers. Times are changing. It\u2019s insane how the four legal plants I have growing 5 feet away from me has put so many people in jail yet it\u2019s no where near as dangerous as alcohol. What strains? I recently started growing and it's actually really sad that cannabis has been outlawed the way it has. It's such a beautiful plant. And it has missed out on decades of proper scientific breeding. Imagine the medicine and quality of herb we'd be growing if people were allowed to really study this plant. the green wave is upon us The tides are high today What\u2019s more dangerous- THC or Alcohol (ethanol)? Asking for a friend. Alcohol withdrawal can kill you real fast Alcohol. Alcohol is by far the more dangerous drug, by many orders of magnitude. It's effects on people's bodies, on their behaviour, and on society writ large are astronomically worse than the impacts of cannabis. What makes it worse, in my view, is that alcohol is socially revered. We celebrate its effects, we glamorize it, we joke with our friends and colleagues about how much we need it, we laugh at  people who are severely intoxicated by it, we gloss over the damaging effects it has on ourselves and others, we think of it as a go-to solution to stressful life situations, we create cute language (e.g. mommy needs her wine!) to soften what is an addictive and dangerous drug. Alcohol is one of the few drugs that, in many cultures, you need an excuse *not* to use. Cannabis is not harmless, but it is not in the same league as alcohol. If you were objectively examining cannabis and alcohol and deciding which one should be illegal, no reasonable person would have concluded cannabis. Both have their risks, but weed doesn't kill. The NHS did a great study on lots of drugs finding their harm to self, harm to others, risk of abuse, etc. It's the source to go to for now and the right way to think about these things. The harms to the individual were: drug-specific mortality drug-related mortality drug-specific damage drug-related damage dependence drug-specific impairment of mental functioning drug-related impairment of mental functioning loss of tangibles (income, housing, job etc) loss of relationships The harms to others were: injury crime environmental damage family adversities international damage economic cost community The only dangerous thing about weed is getting caught with it Alchohol is definitely more dangerous. Alcohol. I don\u2019t think anyone denies that alcohol is more dangerous, but that doesn\u2019t mean that weed not harmful. There are multiple studies that show the negative effects that weed have. So why should we make something that is proven harmful legal? And yes regarding some cases like cancer and chronic pain, weed has proven useful and I think that it should be an option for the patient. But I\u2019m pretty certain that the majority of weed consumers don\u2019t suffer from cancer or chronic pain, they just want to get high. Alcohol is worse Caffeine is also a less dangerous drug, wonder if same category There's gotta be an alternate universe where coffee is banned and stoners meet up in secret to drink it, meanwhile congressmen smoke week for breakfast lmao. Conservative  Americans are why cannabis was outlawed world wide. They forced marijuana prohibition on America and then strong armed other countries into following suit. And yet drug loving Americans still vote conservative to own the Social Justice Warriors they hate so much. It is more because of the tobacco companies paying big bucks to show cannabis in bad light and paying politicians to shut down any attempt of legalization. Fucking Americans. This is entirely incorrect. Weed prohibition had began before america was really even a legitimate country. People would bring marijuana products back from southeast asia, africa, and the middle east into europe which led to places such as france banning hashish. Pls dont be a dumbass and act like the USA is the only country to ever be shitty or racist or really bad about laws or whatever. U kinda just make urself look like a 12 year old who just started watching dr who or something. MAGA should be classified as a detrimental substance The depressing thing is that today, at least at the federal level, it's a bipartisan effort to keep it outlawed. Now do LSD, DMT and Psilocybin! The 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances is a joke. the main reason im even on reddit is that if i try to go without an account i always really wanna upvote these pot posts... so here goes If cannabis is a drug, so is coffee and alcohol how does the UN classify ethanol? If it's not at least classified as a 'more dangerous drug' then the UN is even more of a joke, given the literally overwhemling consensus that alcohol is more addictive, does more societal harm, causes more overdoses and deaths, etc. Not to mention alcohol is a group 1 carcinogen. This article gets one thing wrong: Experts say that the vote will have no immediate impact on loosening international controls because governments will still have jurisdiction over how to classify cannabis. But many countries look to global conventions for guidance, and United Nations recognition is a symbolic win for advocates of drug policy change who say that international law is out of date. Actually the 1961 Single Convention is a non-self-executing treaty, meaning that being party to it requires the state to pass legislation in support of it's terms. The 1970 Controlled Substances Act in the US, and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the UK, are both laws that were passed to comply with Single Convention obligations. Not that the US cares at all, but prior to this reclassification process rescheduling cannabis in the Single Convention, if the US had decriminalized cannabis federally they would have been in violation of their international obligations under the Single Convention. This is actually a HUGE step forward as now every state party to the Single Convention can update their laws accordingly. TLDR; This move essentially removes the international pressure to treat cannabis like a dangerous drug, and allows states parties to relax their cannabis laws with no UN/INCB pressure against. Specifically medical cannabis could now be legalized and regulated in most countries around the world. Fuck research and benefits of drugs. Just let me do drug  regardless man. Lsd won\u2019t cure shit for me, it just makes watching Sfx in movies really fun. Why do we need research of medicinal benefits when it\u2019s just fun. Weed probably harms you more than it helps. That  fine IMO. Cause Alcohol does the same and I can buy that across the block but I gotta go on the outskirts of town to buy legal weed. Come one man. Weed isn\u2019t dangerous? of course it is. So what, I never gotten high enough to feel as shitty as I did drinking two four locos and you can get that at 711. They need to do this with mushrooms and peyote. If more ppl were tripping and having these spiritual experiences I believe the world would be a much better and happier place. Granted everyone would be spun the fuck out but theirs minds would be opened up Oregon just passed a bill that allows  psilocybin mushrooms for use in treatment. We became the party state with legal weed and shrooms. Why is it classified as dangerous at all? It was a political move to throw those that disagreed with Nixon in jail. Reagan later cranked it up for his own reasons. Drug schedules aren't actually related to the potential benefits/harmful effects of a substance. Let plants be plants and make laws about the use, banning plants is beyond retarded. As long as they call it a drug big pharma is getting what they want. Cool now liberate China Only about 60 years too late. tf took the idiots so long? Cool, now do alcohol if pot is still \"dangerous.\" YSK that Marijuana is a sacred herb in Hindu mythology. Lord Shiva used to consume it with his chillum. Unfortunately this became a banned substance even in India due to politics. While we can and certainly should debate the harmful effects and addiction, it has been found that it isn\u2019t as addictive or harmful as other recreational drugs. Taken in moderation, it really helps to calm the mind down. Don't people in India still consume Cannabis in the form of bhang? Is that also illegal? It is dangerous for my diet \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1d Damn at first I read this as the US. Bitch McConnell needs to die so we can have nice things I'm sorry but I think there's a typo in your comment. It should be Bitch McFuckface. I'll smoke to that \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf3f Why do those plants look like bonsai trees? They may want to hire someone who knows that they\u2019re doing. Mother plants - plants held in pre-flowering state to provide clone cuttings that are grown to flower - can often look like bonsai plants, I saw one in the Netherlands many years ago. They know what they're doing, but you just assume it's wrong because   don't know what they're doing lol. Puff Puff Puff...  but we're not there yet. To think that all of that suffering and injustice is mostly the product of racist and cultural supremacism considerations... Too many innocents died as the result of these pointless laws. Cannabis needs to be removed from any scheduled substance list. So when it's convenient for you??? Fuck off un and any bs govt that peddled alcohol, nicotine and meds on every street corner for over a century. Excellent. Next step is to classify it as (mostly) harmless plant. Step by steady step. Advil is more dangerous than weed. Like alcohol and nicotine aren't worse... Thanks UN. Maybe now they can backtrack on the war against Psychedelics its happening..... Cmon Congress\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e It is nice to see these organisations and Governments finally catch up with the Stoners. Drug test this guy NOW HOW ABOUT WHO CARES OF THE MEDICAL USE? HOW ABOUT IT'S JUST FUN? AND NOT DANGEROUS IN ANY WAY What do they classify alcohol as? Is caffeine classified? It's about fucking time. Yeah it\u2019s pretty much medicine Bout fucking time Great! Now hopefully the US will drop it\u2019s schedule classification soon. I\u2019m interested to see the research that comes out about THC, especially looking more deeply into the links between it and increased psychosis or anxiety symptoms. I used to smoke weed. I still do, but i used to, to I\u2019m so sick of this pussyfooting the world does with marijuana... just make it fucking legal for Christ sake Meanwhile just sitting here ordering magic mushrooms online in Canada Everyone can thank NJ for this. Seems like ever since NJ legalized federal courts and the international courts followed suit. I\u2019m kidding but it\u2019s was weird timing. It\u2019s not a drug. It\u2019s a plant. And it was put on this planet to heal humanity. \"U.N. Reclassifies Cannabis as a Less Dangerous Drug A United Nations commission voted to remove marijuana for medical use from a list of the most risky narcotics, such as heroin. Tending crops at a marijuana plantation in North Macedonia. Tending crops at a marijuana plantation in North Macedonia.Credit...Loulou d'Aki for The New York Times Isabella Kwai By Isabella Kwai Dec. 2, 2020 Updated 10:10 a.m. ET A United Nations commission voted on Wednesday to remove cannabis for medicinal purposes from a category of the world\u2019s most dangerous drugs, a highly anticipated and long-delayed decision that could clear the way for an expansion of marijuana research and medical use. The vote by the Commission for Narcotic Drugs, which is based in Vienna and includes 53 member states, considered a series of recommendations from the World Health Organization on reclassifying cannabis and its derivatives. But attention centered on a key recommendation to remove cannabis from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs \u2014 where it was listed alongside dangerous and highly addictive opioids like heroin. Experts say that the vote will have no immediate impact on loosening international controls because governments will still have jurisdiction over how to classify cannabis. But many countries look to global conventions for guidance, and United Nations recognition is a symbolic win for advocates of drug policy change who say that international law is out of date. \u201cThis is a huge, historic victory for us, we couldn\u2019t hope for more,\u201d said Kenzi Riboulet-Zemouli, an independent researcher for drug policy who has closely monitored the vote and the position of member states. He said that cannabis had been used throughout history for medicinal purposes and that the decision on Wednesday reinstated that status. The change will most likely bolster medical research and legalization efforts around the world. The vote was a \u201cbig step forward,\u201d recognizing the positive impact of cannabis on patients, said Dirk Heitepriem, a vice president at Canopy Growth, a Canadian cannabis company. \u201cWe hope this will empower more countries to create frameworks which allow patients in need to get access to treatment.\u201d Marijuana for medical use has exploded in recent years and products containing cannabis derivatives like cannabidiol or CBD, a nonintoxicating compound, have flooded the wellness industry. Cowen, an investment and financial services company, estimates that the CBD industry in the United States will be worth $16 billion by 2025. Some research has suggested that CBD can protect the nervous system and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation. The list of CBD-infused products \u2014 including creams, serums, soda water and juice \u2014 is also expanding rapidly. The recommendations for changing the classification of marijuana were first made by the World Health Organization in 2019. But they were politically divisive, which led to unusual delays in the United Nations commission\u2019s vote. The reclassification passed 27 to 25, with an abstention from Ukraine. The United States and European nations were among those who voted in favor, while the likes of China, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan and Russia were opposed. China\u2019s delegate said that, despite the United Nations move, the country would strictly control cannabis \u201cto protect from the harm and abuse.\u201d Britain\u2019s delegate said that the reclassification was \u201cin line with the scientific evidence of its therapeutic benefits\u201d but that the country still strongly supported international controls for cannabis, adding that marijuana presented \u201cserious public health risks.\u201d The differing messages underline the complexities behind the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s been a diplomatic circus,\u201d said Mr. Riboulet-Zemouli, who added that some countries initially opposed to the change, like France, had since switched their position. Michael Krawitz, executive director for Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access, an advocacy group in the United States, said the change in international law would \u201chelp reduce the suffering millions of people\u201d and could help mitigate reliance on opiates, noting that cannabis was an important medication that could provide unique pain relief. Also on Wednesday, the commission rejected a proposal to include the cannabis derivative THC in the 1961 convention, which would have tightened some controls. The overhaul of cannabis policy, particularly around legalization for medical use, has moved at a rapid pace over the last few years, said Jessica Steinberg, managing director at the Global C, an international cannabis consulting group. Industry insiders have expressed hope that the vote will open the field for more research into the therapeutic benefits of the drug. But the impact on the American and European markets was driving the issue, Ms. Steinberg noted. In the United States, where more states legalized the use of medical and recreational marijuana in the recent election, the market for both of those is expected to expand to more than $34 billion by 2025, according to Cowen. Before the vote this week and other decriminalization efforts, share prices of some cannabis companies jumped. But aside from the financial boon it could provide for American and European marijuana markets, downgrading the dangers of cannabis may have the biggest impact on countries that have more conservative policies, such as many Caribbean and Asian nations. \u201cSomething like this does not mean that legalization is just going to happen around the world,\u201d Ms. Steinberg said. But \u201cit could be a watershed moment.\u201d \" The experts, ladies and gentlemen. This is stupid.. the war on cannabis was only created for profit and to indoctrinate humans.. cannabis should of never been listed as a dangerous drug. Well Done them, hopefully it can be put to medical use, to help people who really need it. This is great. I'm lucky enough to live in Colorado where there are at least three dispensaries within two minutes of my apartment; and as a regular user both medically and recreationally, I can only hope that this paves the way for more innovation. Truly a great day, the UN has finally gained the medical experience of a trailer park hippy in the 1970s. i use cannabis from time to time in various forms, but i still think we need to remember that just because it's becoming more legal, it's still not something we should have around kids, especially in a smoke-able form. second hand smoke is dangerous. I would think edibles/topicals would be more dangerous around children. 5 year old isn't likely to light up a joint. But those cookies or gummies look pretty appealing to a child. That's a fair compromise I'd say. Make it legal but punishable if you smoke round children or in the car with passengers present etc, kinda like how cigarettes are now (disregarding the fact that cigarettes are far more dangerous) i feel the same way cigarettes' but here we are. Is there recent literature showing it\u2019s unhealthy for children? More so than Nighttime Benadryl at least? Not saying it isn\u2019t. I am just skeptical. I\u2019ve been told my entire life it was a schedule 1 drugs (ie NO medicine benefits). And that was obviously bullshit. Why is it still referred to as a drug at all? The fucking government needs to start calling alcohol a drug. You can become dependent on alcohol and the shit will kill you. Marijuana not so much. It\u2019s all about money. They know they couldn\u2019t regulate and tax weed like they do alcohol so piss off with this whole shit show. THC and ethanol are both drugs. That classification isn't related to their potentially harmful/beneficial effects. They absolutely could regulate and tax it. But the tobacco industry keeps paying politicians to keep it out because who the fuck would smoke tobacco if weed was legal? Why dangerous at all? Blood pressure and heart rate increase in addition to various mental stability issues I\u2019d assume Thailand changed laws today also Blame Canada :) \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 Good move. My weed stocks :) pls continue. Are those weed bonsais?\ud83d\ude0d Pog! But didn\u2019t we know this already? I just hope good research keeps coming out Everytime I see the word cannabis, I read cannibal. Idiots finally realized. Took them long enough. disable javascript in chrome than reload the page. Fuck the NY Times It\u2019s about damn time That\u2019s a heavy prune...that\u2019s what I take away. how is it dangerous? Why isn\u2019t hemp becoming a thing now it is legal in some/most countries Oh god what did they do to those plants in the banner image? Talk about lollipop ping... Don\u2019t be fooled, they didn\u2019t classify it as \u201cless dangerous\u201d until it was convenient for them to do so. Where is alcohol on the list? About time! Less than 1% and he is doing next \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4 wabbo do dont dingdong Das macht es noch lange nicht zu Brokkoli! Interesting how this news is released after the talks of adding cancer warnings to alcohol products like beer and whiskey have circulated online Reminder, weed should still be taken responsibly. Start with edibles where you can easily control your dosage and start small until you know your tolerance. So many people smoke too much their first time and have a bad experience. It's the equivalent of drinking Everclear straight from the bottle for your first alcoholic beverage. Bad advice, starting with edibles is a recipe for disaster. There are too many factors to consider with edibles. Start with a dry herb vape if you have access to it, even distillate with low THC % can do the trick. Sublingual spray / oil is also more forgiving than edibles, start small. Shouldve been done like 10 years ago but okay.... Corporate Cannabis. Yeees finally!!! This single UN convention or whatever was the main thing the government brought up whenever we had a petition to legalize in our country! Which pissed me off, Canada signed that as well and went ahead with legalization, so why couldn't we?! Now they will at least have to make up their own reasons to keep it illegal instead of citing this 50 year old document back at us again and again. Yay for Weed Stocks! Just look at how happy *most Canadians are ! Thanks captain obvious I smoke everyday...still don't have the urge to try stronger drugs. All those anti drug commercials were   its more like  Article and UN decision aside, how stupid are the growers in the photo? Like what the fuck are those? Butchered the plants lol. Fucking finally. After the US bullied them to upgrade drugs like LSD and marijuana up the list Until cannabis is classified as less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco they can\u2019t be taken seriously. \u270a\ud83c\udffd I guess theyre getting closer to finding a way to effectively tax the shit out of it Damn, the UN itself? Oh wait, noone will care Wow that photo is wholesome af. How does that affect legislation in UN friendly countries? How about not dangerous at all! Great! Now let\u2019s expunge the records of those who were jailed for years. Less dangerous than? Alcohol? Prescription pain killers? No no, they straight up had it on a list that included Heroin. To be fair, if we\u2019re weighting this comparison based on relative danger to health, alcohol, pain killers, and heroin all belong on the same list. A list titled  That\u2019s an interesting growing technique I see in the picture, anyone have any idea what that is called?

{"UK approves Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine for mass roll out": ["Around 10m doses should be available soon, with the first 800,000 arriving in the UK in the coming days. I wonder how much of that is stock they have been building up while waiting for approval, and what the production capacity is.  It is still a good quick start to immunise frontline workers. Pfizer said they can produce 80m doses this year and up to 1.3B doses next year. They will have been producing these and other promising vaccine candidates in expectation of the green light for a fast rollout. Sorry, scalpers have already stockpiled all the vaccines using bots. If you want one now you have to buy them on Ebay or Marketplace. United airlines has already begun to fly and distribute the Pfizer vaccine at least to the US. Multiple 777s have been bringing over vaccines from Brussels to United\u2019s hub in Chicago since last Friday. Insane logistical hurdle to fly with dry ice to make it happen There's a great Freakonomics about vaccines. Well worth a listen. Countries have been pre ordering vaccines from multiple pharma's in the millions. They're basically funding a lot of the work and manufacturing. almost all of it, they started mass-producing it as soon as they had something ready for testing I think That is part of the reason this is available so fast. They had a positive initial sample, and immediately started production on that vaccine. If it didn\u2019t work, all they lose is money. Normally, production of a vaccine does not start until all the trials are complete. In the before times, we would normally just be   production now. Here\u2019s a very interesting article for anyone curious! Also I really hope these historic vaccine successes help humanity appreciate biomedical science and public health more. We\u2019ve been taking it for granted far too long. But really, this is a proud day for humanity. Dude we can\u2019t even appreciate the original threat... Don\u2019t bode well for us appreciating the prevention. I was just thinking how I\u2019m feeling an inexplicable sense of pride right now and I just realised it\u2019s basically what you said. Pride in humanity. This is an incredible achievement and one of those   moments. This article makes it sound as if Pfizer had the longterm strategy to develop Corona mRNA vaccines and asked Biontech to help them. In fact BionTech developed a strategy which is called light speed, contacted German and European Institutions very early on, had already the working vaccine developed in January, when most of the Western world didn't even took Corona seriously and only contacted Pfizer in March to help them with testing. Can't really be proud because for once we did the right thing even though it's probably for the wrong reasons. Yay, we were rational, awesome! /s Thanks for sharing. That was a great article. What are the expectations on global travel resuming over the next 12 months with vaccine rollout now starting at the end of 2020? Say, From Australia to the UK, for example? I imagine it will gated behind either being vaccinated and/or having a recent negative test until the world is satisfied with how many are immunised Wow. To get a vaccine out THIS fast, is honestly an incredible achievement in human history. And it\u2019s an absolutely   vaccine too! Now imagine what we could do if we put this much effort and resources into solving the climate emergency. Arguably the much bigger threat to our existence. Edit because this comment has gained a little traction: I think how fast we found a solution for Covid-19 shows what we can achieve. It makes me hopeful we can also solve the climate crisis. If I had seen this headline in April omg no way They had a head start from the last 2 SARS, still impressive. It's a fast beta test. Hijacking top comment to bring a guide to different vaccine types, since there\u2019s so much misinformation. This is from Nature (a top scientific academic journal): This is what it looks like when scientosts are given unlimited funding to develop something Fuck yeah! Fuck off, Covid Fuck covid. All my homies hate covid Fuck off, Covid In true British fashion, to the tune of Come On, Eileen. I bet we're going to be hearing this in crowds along with trumpets to those same three notes as \"come on England!\" Fuck you, Covid It\u2019s time to get out of The UK, Covid What were you even doing there in the first place, Covid? You didn\u2019t even get everyone infected, Covid Are you happy now, Covid? Fuck you, Covid. All the scientists, researchers, volunteers, and all the behind the scenes workers who have worked so hard to get this vaccine (and all the others) to this point deserve some kind of award. I\u2019d be surprised and simultaneously unsurprised if they don\u2019t win the Nobel in physiology and medicine at least Everyone's done their part. Thank you for this comment. Reddit gold? Clapping begins at 8 everyone! About time, I hope the Oxford one also turns out to be as effective, as it can be stored and transported safely in developing countries unlike the Pfizer one Just for comparison, going to throw in here that the flu vaccine is about 59% effective in adults 18-65. The Oxford one is 5% less effective and it is hoped it'll be approved by the end of the year. One point of clarification is that the Pfizer vaccine can likely also be transported at 5C as it is using the same delivery system. Pfizer simply didn\u2019t do a temperature study like Oxford so they can\u2019t officially claim that. About time? Never before was a medical application developed this quickly before. Usually it takes about 10 years and costs 2 billion dollars to get medicine on the market. One year is insanly fast! This is amazing. How is this not really big news on Reddit? Americans are asleep at the moment. American here, how big is this news in terms of football fields? On the east coast it is currently 6 am. Give it a couple of hours. People dont like the UK here, can guarantee a bad news story about the UK/Boris would be way more upvoted It is, you just have to give it a bit of time. American here. I just woke up and I am over the fucking moon. This news just instantly brightened my mood, I don't think it will be possible for me to have a bad today. I'm so proud of the virologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, biochemists and of the course the   who chose to put themselves out there for humanity. What a fucking achievement. This is such good news. They've built a centre in my city already that can vaccinate 100k people a week. The government has fucked up so much during this crisis, I really hope I can look back in a few months and say they stuck the landing Credit goes to the scientists and the career civil servants. In the rest of european union, we must wait for the official green light from the EU. Godspeed to UK though. The last words spoken before the zombie outbreak started. They had a great start with the far-more-left-wing-than-anyone-expected 80% furlough scheme. Looks like we're having a great end too, being the first country to approve a vaccine. Shame they fucked up basically everything in the middle. getting a vaccine is gonna be like trying to get an xbox series x or a ps5 lol Scalpers going to sell the vaccine on Facebook marketplace and eBay  /s Pretty much the opposite demographics though. The government have set out what order people will get it in, so if you're a young, healthy person, it's gonna be a while. But that's okay, it's far more important to protect the vulnerable and front line workers. Genuinely curious at how they\u2019re going to roll it out. Getting booked for a test was a nightmare to start and this will be in such a higher demand. Good news regardless! They're gonna be in stacks at the local Target like the consoles were on Saturday? Sweet, though they're gonna have to crank the AC in Target to like -70C I guess. Let\u2019s get this vaccine train rollin. I know it\u2019ll take some time to roll out, but I\u2019m hype. We\u2019re on our way back to normalcy boys! Hats off to everyone involved in making this vaccine happen in record time. I\u2019m curious to see how quickly/efficiently the U.K. will roll this out to the public. Hopefully we hear an approval from the U.S. and EU in the coming weeks/days. This is definitely a step in the right direction. The U.K. has really impressive logistics and I\u2019m sure they are going to get the army and basically everyone involved in the process, today they said they are going to create vaccination centres in the nightingales model and this will be alongside a community model in which the vaccine that does not need to be stored at -70c will be used in local gps! The relief our healthcare systems will get just by vaccinating our healthcare workers is good news. Right now they have to work under unbelievable stress. Know of two people (healthcare workers) confirmed to be getting it next week. The hospitals started planning at least a week earlier, hopefully more. Hopefully it's quick and much more successful than anything else the government has tried to do this year! EU decision is due on 29 Dec for the Pfizer vaccine and 12 Jan for the Moderna one. It was posted but not really upvoted, so posting it here to provide that information to people who hadn't seen it. I'm really worried about all the anti-vaxxers, they're all over youtube comment sections, news articles and facebook, full of conspiracy theories. Really hope it's not going to pose an issue and this is just a vocal minority. Well if it\u2019s anything like my flu vaccine at the weekend, pretty impressive. Everyone had to be masked and stay 2m apart. You were then given a 1 minute slot, which you had to be on time for with your arm out ready to go. There were two nurses vaccinating. I\u2019ve not seen it done like that ever here. Ramp the amount of people up doing the vaccinations, you could do a lot of people quite quickly. I believe the FT (who called this approval about a week ago) are saying the EU won't approve until end of the month. I am SO ready to go and stand awkwardly in bars again! I\u2019ll have this shot as soon as I can, I\u2019m not in a severe at risk group but am close to those who are. i have been immuno suppressed due to medication and that ends soon. the condition was respiratory and covid would definitely have finished me off 4 weeks ago. i can't wait for the opportunity to get this and the gp says i will be in the first tranche when it's available to her woot! Yeah if you're not an NHS worker or an old/vulnerable person, you're going to be waiting a long time. Not fussed when I get it, I just want my grandmother to get it so myself and family can visit her again Doesn't this vaccine only protect you from the affects, not make you not infectious? It's multiple shots Unless you're in a high priority group you're more likely to end up with the AstraZeneca Vaccine when it rolls around - its much cheaper and easier to distribute. It will be the more common vaccine once it's hit the market. Me too. When I went to get a vaccine booster the other day the pharmacist said probably March for us normal folk. And TBH I'm fine with that, it was way sooner than most of the doomsayers were saying we'd get one. Get it to people who need it most, first. I can keep waiting/taking precautions as long as I can get the vaccine sooner rather than later. How long does the vaccine last, does everyone have to get it every year? They're hoping for multiple years worth of immunity, but there's no way to be sure, considering it's been less than a year since they even started the vaccine. I think the idea might be that if enough people get it we achieve herd immunity, and maybe the virus will have nowhere to go, reducing the need for followup vaccines. This may be wrong tho, I'm no expert, so feel free to correct me. Finally, an end in sight The light of the tunnel is slowly but surely coming. For first world countries. My friend is a care worker in the UK, so excited for her to get it! My mum is, so I share this sentiment. Not to mention that she literally cannot afford to live if she has to take time off work if she gets the virus. In addition, she is not protected whatsoever from it as she works in a care home who do not take the virus seriously enough from the sounds of it. Yeah, I have several care worker family members, one of whom hasn't been able to work as she's also in a high risk group, so I'm very happy they'll be able to get it soon. As a care worker in the UK also, thank you for thinking of us \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m very happy for our friends in the UK! The end is finally coming into sight. Delivery and usage starts within a week! Great news to wake up to. I'd take this tomorrow if I could To the good people of the UK, I hope you guys get over this pandemic as fast as possible. I wish you all well and I hope you start seeing less numbers by febuary. Meanwhile I gotta enjoy that operation warp speed being slower than the UK lol. What a joke my country is right now. Glad to see kind messages from people instead of the usual Reddit hostility! I hope this works and I hope our Oxford vaccine works so we can share it with the world, including developing countries because it doesn't need to be frozen. We're set to approve it on the 12th I believe.  is shitting themselves Covid was a new world order ploy to get everyone to give up their rights to the government. Next comes microchips via vaccine. You'll get a card with your vaccine that you'll have to show to enter stores or travel. Soon you'll all be forced into labor camps to work for the new world order. I look forward to Scott Hall and Kevin Nash being our new leaders, but I'm not so sure about Hollywood Hulk Hogan. A jab   a National ID card, they must be going insane! For people who are worried that this vaccine was made \"too fast\": We are used to vaccine development taking decades because that's what we saw in our lifetimes. But the early vaccines were so easy that physicians in the 1800's who didn't really know what viruses were could develop a rudimentary vaccine within a few months of work. Vaccine research for existing diseases is only slow because the easy problems got solved centuries ago, we are stuck with the hardest nuts to crack. Covid is a brand-new virus, it could have been as easy as rabies or as hard as HIV, I think we simply got lucky. If it was more like SARS1, we might still be stuck on the animal research phase. Historically, infectious disease vaccines that reach Phase 3 trials have an 85% probability of success (source :  ) . It normally takes years for the trials to pass because volunteers generally get infected at a fixed rate. Covid was spreading so rapidly that this process was greatly accelerated. The trials were not rushed, the evidence of was just generated at an extremely fast pace. The trials were not rushed, the evidence of was just generated at an extremely fast pace. This isn't fully accurate. The trials were absolutely shortened. That's why they're applying for emergency authorization with the various regulatory bodies. I'm not saying it's a concern, just pointing out that the results from the trials are preliminary analysis. The trials are on-going and aren't completed. They'll continue to track those involved and record data. I'm absolutely not anti-vax, but the thing I don't get is how it is possible to study long term side effects of a drug that hasn't been through a long term trial. I don't doubt the effectiveness of the cure, I'm mostly concerned about the above. I also don't know how it's usually done, but I'm sceptical about there not having been taken any shortcuts at all. I remember a friend who works in medicine saying that usually the delay with most vaccine trials is bureaucratic paperwork. And since the covid vaccine is desperately needed, that paperwork was mostly eliminated so it could be fast-tracked. I get people concerned about the risk of long-term effects, but I'd rather take a very small gamble on unlikely long-term effects of this vaccine vs. well-documented and proven long-term effects of covid. Great news. I\u2019ve always been amazed by medical workers, people who spend each day helping others and seeing countless horrible and heartbreaking things, and this pandemic really has cemented in my mind just how brave and selfless these front-line workers are. I\u2019m very happy that soon they will be able to work without the fear of contracting COVID, and hopefully now be able to look forward to the end of this pandemic. How much of the population has to be vaccinated for it to kill off COVID? They\u2019re saying 70% should do it. Just out of curiosity because I\u2019m not entirely sure, is there a chance of long term side effects being undiscovered due to how quickly it\u2019s been produced? I\u2019m not entirely sure how the process works and wanted to know if it was something to worried or not. If not inject it into my vainssss Can't study long term effects of Corona either, but one seems better than the other Like a guy above said and i quote \"High effectiveness and since it's an mRNA vaccine it's much safer than traditional vaccines. You don't get the dangerous parts of the virus injected only the spike protein which is harmless. Also everything you get injected is gone after a few weeks so there is basically no risk of negative long-term effects.\" I'd also like to know this! I'm not against vaccines at all, I've just heard stories about vaccines in the past having long-term side affects and am worried it could be the same case here. Would appreciate any knowledge anyone has to share. I'm not completely on board because I still remember the Pandemrix vaccine. Gonna end up with a COVID vaccine before I get my RTX 3080. It'll be really interesting to see how Reddit reacts to this. The demographic tends to be a younger pro vaccine audience but at the same time anti UK due to its colonial past. Some big mixed responses coming I think. I've already seen other posts on this immediately bring up Scotland which is crazy and nothing to do with this but that's Reddit for you. It's an amazing achievement of the UK regulatory, scientific, and educational bodies. Honestly if you'd told me we'd have a vaccine by December I'd not have believed it. No one should fall for the loud minority either. The UK has a low number of anti vaxxers and is massively a progressive, science based culture that cares for the vulnerable. The priority list that has been released shows that the most vulnerable will get this vaccine first. I'm proud of my country and its achievements today despite many other areas for criticism that absolutely do exist. The UK is still world class in many areas and while I didn't vote Brexit and hate that we're leaving the EU I still have high hopes that Britain will continue to be an inclusive society where we welcome people from across the world. Those same people from all over the world that were involved in this vaccine, our Oxford vaccine, and our healthcare system. As someone from the UK I'm so happy. I think the govt knew how much we needed this which is how it's got done and dusted so early, because there are so many people not taking the rules seriously. I've already had Covid and had very light symptoms (as a young healthy person) but my father in his 80's will be getting this, he is still teaching piano at home and living mostly by himself so things have been very hard for him. And me making sure I don't give it to him. The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years This is such a huge achievement in Human History .. hopefully, everything goes well, and we get our normal life back soon What people need to realise when they see timeframe is that most vaccines take so long because of funding application and processing paperwork etc. It'll be interesting to see the widespread impact of this whether it speeds up approval elsewhere, or will countries wait and see it's effect on the Brits. The US will be approving this in December, the EU will approve it by Jan. Absolutely incredible achievement. Just out of interest, what happens to the mRNA in the cells? Does it simply breakdown when the cell is destroyed by the immune system or can it replicate itself? It's broken down shortly after it's translated, mRNA is not a very stable molecule. Wooo the beginning of the end Science saves our ungrateful asses. Again. I will not be getting this vaccine until it's been out and used for a while... Largely because I'm not in the age range or occupation to get it. In fact those are the only reasons. Beware the fucking idiot conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers in the comments. This is a great win for all of humanity and we made history. Some people have been watching way to much TV... Kudos to the UK for authorizing it this quickly. Boy am I   looking forward to anti-vaxxer nitwits shitting things up everywhere, though. And I'm sitting here watching AWS Re:invent 2020 videos and, presuming he's being accurate, the guy speaking now says Moderna, another vaccine manufacturer, used machine learning and rapid expansion of compute resources. I welcome anti-vaxxer nitwits. One less person in the queue for a vaccine and sane people can get on with business in semi-normality. Take me back to the motherland please \ud83d\ude28 I hope my mom can get it when it comes to the US. :( My 2 shares I bought of Pfizer and moderna should be making me a millionaire any day now \ud83d\ude02 So my company just announced they will begin giving vaccines to front line workers first. I work for a major hospital corporation. I agree with this, that ER and intensive care units get them first, however I work in xray and we are ALL over the hospital, including the ER. We are as much front line as the er and icu in the sense that we are always in there doing xrays. However we are not included in the first rounds, and have to wait til everyone else gets them. It's typical though, xray always gets the last of things.. Whoa, that\u2019s pretty crazy news. Awesome! Who knows if the public is willing to take the vaccine. There are so many conspiracies spreading and anti-vaccinations are at its high. Good luck UK! Alfie from Wolverhampton with a btec in PE - \u201cNah it ain\u2019t possible m8, never takin that vaccine m8.\u201d I'm looking forward to the 28 days after the start of the vaccination Proud moment to be British, the NHS workers desperately deserve this. Also sounds like they'll be receiving it along with the elderly as early as possible. Yep elderly and care home workers first then NHS workers Great news, I am ready to become Blinky and see the world again. People, as good as this is, remember that actual mass roll out will take months, because of production and distribution bottlenecks! Stay safe!! I have so many questions but since this post has been up for a while I doubt anyone will see it. Why are two shots a month apart required? How much of an impact will this be if people only get the first shot? I know that they said they could have 1.3 billion vaccines produced by the end of next year so worldwide ~650 million will be vaccinated. I know that other companies are producing vaccines so that number will definitely go up but how long will it take for there to be a noticeable impact? I worry is that people will see that the vaccine is going to be rolling out soon and let their guard down. My biggest concern is how the hospitals will hold up over the next couple of months with winter kicking in. I\u2019m not trying to be a downer or take away from the hope this brings. I just hope people understand that they still need to take covid seriously for now while they celebrate this great news. 1: to build both short & long-term immune cells, according to the Biontech  CEO. Lots of ordinary vaccinations require booster shots too, after all. It's not unusual. 2:  They'll likely only build short-term immunity, the kind that fades in 90-120 days. When Biontech publishes the data soon, there'll likely be more in-depth info on this. 3: The CEO estimates 9-12 months before we can abandon our masks.  Happy vaccine day everyone! can't any nation produce their own vaccine now by just copying the formula of phizer? well, whatever happened to that Astrazeneca-oxford vaccine? I hope they dont stop with that, rest of the developing world is kind of counting on that vaccine. I feel like this is going to create an economic vaccine class system, where rich countries get the pfizer/moderna vaccine and everyone else gets the azn-oxford vaccine We\u2019re in the endgame now. I am by no means anti-vax, and have had many vaccines in my life, but isn't it kinda spooky taking a vaccine that hasn't been tested for very long at all, relative to every other vaccine? Generally the rapid development has been due to: existing technologies to build on. understanding other coronavirus mechanism of action. Basically running phase I, II and III concurrently. As opposed to 2 years of each, sequentially. Low financial risk of advancing through trials due to extreme demand. Isn't a new flu vaccine developed every year? People seem fine taking that. What's the difference? Good on ya. Lots of bots in here Do u know because u are one? Imagine if this constitutes a return to normalcy, God I never imagined I would be missing 2019 why wouldnt it Unfortunately in the US, when the vaccine becomes readily available we can expect up to half the country to not get the vaccine based on their conspiracies. Might be a stupid question but has it been proven this is safe long term? Feels awfully rushed It feels rushed because researchers usually have to wait for funding, approval etc. which is  what takes up the time. In this case, funding was almost immediately available and everyone placed the research as highest priority. It\u2019s the bureaucracy and begging for funding that\u2019s been rushed, not the testing and trialling. This vaccine is dramatically different to any vaccine in the past, because it\u2019s been the top of every single priority list since February. Even down to the recruiters finding junior level chemical engineers to work in the manufacturing plants (I interviewed for some of those roles - the whole process from getting a call from a recruiter to feedback from the interview saying I didn\u2019t get the job was under two weeks) If it\u2019s approved, it\u2019s approved. Every person that\u2019s involved with approving this is very well aware of those concerns, and know it\u2019s many thousands of lives on the line if they get it wrong. As they\u2019re the scientists, I\u2019ll trust them to know more about it than me Not trying to be pessimistic and am the furthest thing from an anti vaxxer, but I\u2019m holding off for a couple of months. The quickest vaccine in human history, with limited tests as well as any long term effects that may not be known yet. I\u2019d rather stay socially distanced and keep a mask on for a few more months, then get the shot. Most countries will be rolling out the vaccine to frontline medical workers and the elderly in the 1st instance. Unless you are in those groups you will probably have to wait a few months regardless. Unless you're in one of the risk groups you won't be asked to have one probably until next summer anyway. Replace months with years. You need a herd immunity. The only way to get it is vaccinate the herd. Someone has to GP, thank you UK! I am so happy. The end is in sight. Britain has pre-ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, which was 95% effective in a late stage clinical trial. THANK FUCKING GOD Cries in American America will have it within a few weeks. They can\u2019t afford not to. Fascinating.  I\u2019m not sure how it is in the UK within the United States there seems to be this perception that as soon as anybody starts getting the vaccine everything\u2018s going to go back to \u201cnormal\u201c. People don\u2019t seem to understand that even as average people in the population have access to the vaccine masks, social distancing and closed businesses are still going to be there. The UK does have the advantage of a national social health system, that can be geared up for nationwide inoculation (which it is in the process of doing). The health market in the US is so fractured, and there's no central command system that can be used in emergencies. We haven't burned down nearly enough 5G towers. We've really taken our eye off the ball. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but how good will this actually be long term? From what I\u2019ve heard getting the virus only gives you immunity for a few months at best, so I\u2019m assuming it will be the same for a vaccine? If so do we just have to keep constantly taking this every few months forever? I know it\u2019s kind of similar with the flu vaccine but that\u2019s seasonal, and so far COVID hasn\u2019t showed any signs of being worse at different times of the year. Sorry if this sounds stupid it just seems like even with a vaccine things can\u2019t go back to normal The idea is, that with enough people having immunity across the population that it can get down it\u2019ll effectively become no longer in wide circulation and to the eventual goal of eradication (yay!). Also with a vaccine you usually get a booster jab that extends the immunity so your white blood cells can store the \u2018code\u2019 to respond to another infection in future :) From what I\u2019ve heard getting the virus only gives you immunity for a few months at best, so I\u2019m assuming it will be the same for a vaccine? I think that is not clear. As far as I heard, it is not fully understood why the immunity might not last that long, and it is very well possible that this class 2 vaccine can circumvent the reasons for that. The body is told in a completly different way to form antibodies, so it is very well possible that it works longterm. Big pharma would never lie for money  if the vaccine will be available in a specific country / region.. will it be mandatory for everyone or will it be free to choose if you want to do it or not (i guess most people want to)? or will it maybe even depend on your job / work you do? how will this be done? i never thought about this whole thing in detail but now i'm curious how this will be likely be done. edit: i'm not anti-vax, just curious about how it will be rolled out likely. I don't think it will be mandatory in most democratic countries. I can imagine it being mandatory for certain occupations such as healthcare. So, I can\u2019t answer for everywhere, but in my country you cannot be forced to take the vaccine. If you are a hospital worker, maybe. IIRC I did however hear that since some of the vaccines have a 95% efficiency you only need like 3/4 of the population to vaccinate to reach herd immunity - a lot of older adults are very skeptical after the whole swine flu vaccine thing, where some of the recipients developed things like epilepsy. I didn't think i'd get so emotional at the news, my nan has COPD and more than anything im so happy for her, she will finally get some normalcy back after an horrific year. Well done to the scientists and those volunteers willing to put their bodies on the line for testing. I know we're running out of time, with the global economy collapsing due to covid and corners are inevitably going to be cut, but I really hope this vaccine has no adverse effects. That being said, I'll still get it as soon as I can. It appears that the only adverse effects are things like headaches, fever, general aches, and fatigue that last around 2 days. Outside of that, there has been little report of anything extraordinarily bad. That being said, I\u2019d take that 3 times over instead of COVID. give me all of the vaccines right now This is great! Hopefully the US follows suit. Also, I'm assuming this means Pfizer and BioNTech stock will be rising come morning? Time to finish my vaccination course, business is boomin This day is history. Vaccination will take a while, I see that they'll likely only get the vaccine rolled out to everyone by end of spring / early summer, optimistically. What are the risks of someone who is vaccinated acting like they are totally immune? Can they still spread it? Increased chance of mutations? This is the light at the end of the tunnel. Talk is cheap but when approvals are done, it's a bit of a relief after months of never knowing. WOOHOO!!!! fuck yessss Humans ... We get shit done ! I hope enough have been rolled out and used before christmas, not for me though (I'm happy to have an excuse not to leave my house) but for the morons who are stupid enough to travel without a vaccine but not quite stupid enough to be anti vax Let's goooo bois!!! i can't wait to get back into theaters and concerts I sat in a lecture with the chief pharmacist of the Sussex NHS trust, they believe they will have vulnerable groups vaccinated by March, which is excellent news. Fuck yeah !! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f I'm so proud of that happening this fast in the UK! This vaccine hopefully will help on reducing the virus greatly over there! stick it in me So I am uneducated on this subject. Why is the UK getting the vaccine first as opposed to the US or other European countries? FDA is setting for emergency review I believe on the 7th of December. If approved then roll out to USA This should be top of front page. Do people only upvote bad news? Did they said who will be vaccinated first?some news say frontline workers, others high risk groups care home residents and their carers are first on the list Great news! Lets just hope there's nothing in the near future which may slow down imports or cause issues at our ports... ...oh shit. BRB moving to uk Trump will blow a fuse, because \"he\" is not 1st to confirm. Saved by the Germans. Remind me in 28 days..... In all seriousness though this is awesome Faster.

I have an older Samsung smart TV (prob 8 years old, not sure of model but that doesn\u2019t matter) that I want to upgrade for my new Xbox Series X - it is wall mounted with a long HMDI (male to female) extender thru the wall, and out into a Denon AVR-1913. Another HDMI is connected to my Xbox One X currently into the receiver. If I get a new 4K UHD TV, would I need a new HDMI 2.1/4K male-to-female extender thru the wall? Would that have any performance issues? Or am I SOL with the cord being ran thru the wall and not directly into the new XSX? Thanks! First off, if this is not the right place to put this question, just let me know. My actual question: Reddit keeps showing me advertisements for porn. I do not do porn, nor do I ever intend to. How do I make it stop showing me these ads? I tried reporting the ones by Google as inappropriate, but that doesn't do anything, and not all of them are by Google. Go to your browser settings and look for suspicious add-ons and extensions. Reddit doesn't show advertisements for porn, but a dodgy add-on will stuff ads into legitimate sites.

{"'Tis The Season: Congress Looks To Sneak In Unconstitutional Copyright Reform Bill Into 'Must Pass' Spending Bill": ["It involves the executive branch trying to route around the courts to set up a judicial body to handle disputes about private rights Copyright that can (will) be used to censor internet content. This is like mandatory arbitration in contracts. Bingo. They get this out of the courts, make you arbitrate with your fucking HOA when you have a property dispute, force immigrants into a second class court, shit I bought a new car last year and toyota attempted to have me sign an arbitration agreement for the purchase. It's out of control. Not a real democracy. Except it's not mandatory, which is probably why it isn't unconstitutional. Also it looks like this passed the House in 2019, so I'm not sure how it ended up tied to a Spending Bill in 2020. Not unless copyright holders start dropping like flies. 'cause if we want the world to continue, copyright holders and enforcers are going to have to drop like flies unless the bill is wiped from existence. Tax, EPA, domain names, ICE, Military courts... Wait, Senate is part of the Legislative branch Someone needs to setup a YouTube alternative that works like torrents. Decentralized and controlled by no one. So giving corporations all the power. Oh boy... how bad is it? The CASE act would allow either party to opt out within 60 days, it isn't mandatory. And really the underlying issue is that litigating copyright claims are prohibitively expensive. It can cost well over $100k in attorneys fees for a case that goes to trial. Even at a basic level, ignoring the attorneys fees it is cost prohibitive for many. If someone infringes on your work, you send a DMCA, they file a couterclaim, usually the host will publish the work again until you show you have filed a lawsuit. To do that you need to get confirmation of copyright registration before you can start a lawsuit for infringement. This costs as little as $45, but then it takes 6-8 months to get your registration back. Or for $800 you can expedite the request and get it back within a week. Then the filing fees for federal court are around $400, plus $50-$100 to serve the defendant. Only then could you have the infringing content removed. Defacto, unless you are very wealthy you do no have access to the court system, those that do can already censor you. The CASE act allows for claims without registration (and paying this fee to expedite), lowering your upfront cost, and allowing you to take action against an infringer without a 6+ month wait. The discovery process is simplified, greatly lowering attorneys fees. destruction of section 230 of the DMCA will fuck us all In order to use this court to sue, the claimant must have properly filed a copyright with the copyright board, and had that claim accepted. If you don't prove that you hold the copyright to the work in question then you do not get to use this court system. The only copyright bill I want to see passed limits all copyright to 40 years.  Patents are only valid for 20 years so why the hell is copyright basically forever. Disney didn't want other people to make money off public domain like they've been doing for decades so paid a bunch senators lots of money. lol in your   copyrights still last half of a long lifetime. Read Free Culture. tldr: Return copyright to an opt-in, rather than copyrighting everything automatically for around a century. MY fantasy: 1st year from the creation of a work: normal copyright rules we have now (automatic copyright registration) Every year after: geometrically increasing cost to register. Ex., $15, then $30, then $100, then $500, then $1000, and so on. Most art makes or doesn't make its money within a few years of release. Most art is just a waste of its government-granted copyright monopoly 10, 20, 50, 100 years after release. If we're talking about Steamboat Willie (1928), if you assume that it shouldn't just be public domain, the cost should reflect the cost to the public not being able to remix it freely. On the order of $10,000,000+ per work per year. The net effect will be 99+% of copyrighted works will go to the public domain, where they belong, and it will finally become commercially viable to re-issue and preserve them. Disney can have Mickey Mouse. There's some cultural loss, but people focus on the mouse and lose sight of all the works we're actively losing. MM is under lock and key in Disney archives. Other art is literally withering away. Greatly limit the cases where copyright is implicated. As Free Culture explains, a book has limited copyright implications, but an ebook has copyright implications every step of the way - downloading, copying, reading, sharing with a friend, re-selling. Greatly expand fair use, remix, sharing, decryption/hacking/jailbreaking, and first sale rights. Look at Creative Commons for inspiration. Patents expire to prevent monopolizing. Imagine if only one person or company could make telephones for example? Obviously not good. \u201cPatents are meant to give the inventor an advantage, not a monopoly.\u201d (I forget where I read that quote but I feel like it summarizes my point pretty well.) Copyright doesn\u2019t expire because there\u2019s not really anything to monopolize. If Disney is still using Mickey Mouse, other people shouldn\u2019t be able to just take their characters. What are they monopolizing? The Mickey Mouse industry? That\u2019s just my take on it at least. Death plus 10 years is a good standard. 40 years is still a stretch, but then again, so is one minute. The ownership of ideas is a disgusting enterprise tied to capitalism's deep problems and core failings as a system and concept and nothing else, it's a shitty bandaid for an even shittier problem. All ideas belong to all people. No person exists alone, no idea comes from a vacuum, everything from sharpening a rock to mickey mouse to Michael Jackson's Thriller to assembling a nuclear reactor are the rightful intellectual property of all human beings. The sharing of ideas is the only thing that makes us miserable apes even notable as a species in our history books. Woah, woah. Patents and copyrights are about as similar as mail postage and phonesex hotlines. \"Okay, I can make a generic version of viagra now\" and \"Mickey Mouse is mine now too\" are NOT comparable in the way you claim. How can we stop it? The American people actually nut-up and start asking these people these questions every fucking single second these whores masquerading as politicians leave their houses. Give them absolutely ZERO PEACE outside of their own homes. Hold these fuckers accountable for...hell, fucking ANYTHING. Actually threaten our leaders like people did in the past By making your legislators fear the electorate again. Because our attention is being focused on whether or not we can go outside and do things because of COVID. They\u2019re intentionally dividing our attention and making us fight over stupid things while they sit here and do this. Vote in primaries, contact your reps, be a millionaire donator Well when France tried to pass a law they didn't like, they started rioting and burning down banks. France has shelved the law. Can't. Whole system is permanently fucked. Trump has been a nightmare for sure, but the complete lack of care by the american people along with the ignorant hate that has permeated and divided every group in this nation has made it pretty fucking easy for these devil's to take more and more control. Rip. Shit is still better than alot of third world countries though. So count your blessings while you still can Yay, fuck a stimulus, let\u2019s make big telecom happy. Big telecom? No, this is a bill to make the RIAA happy. Look at who's lobbying for this. Didn\u2019t Trump also try and threaten to veto the bill unless they also repeal Section 230, the very bill that keeps free speech on the internet alive Why is this even possible? I don't live in the US, and I'm confused as to why this kind of stuff is even constitutional and possible to begin with? It really shouldn\u2019t be legal but many Americans have learned that the best parts of our government are tradition not legality. All it takes is a few assholes to ruin everything. First, there is no rule that a bill has to be constitutional to be passed by Congress and Executive Branch (President).  A bill has to be challenged up through the Judicial (Supreme Court) to get ruled unconstitutional.  Thus the US \"three co-equal branches of government\" that make bills reality. Second, there is also nothing that requires a bill to be all about a single topic so what happens is bullshit like this copyright reform gets added to critical funding bills that have to pass to keep money flowing to government agencies/processes.  This is why from time to time we have government shut downs where some add on to critical spending bills is atrocious enough to one of the branches that they opt to take their toys and go home which results in funding stopping and government shutting down. Another interesting note is that our constitution is the oldest existing constitution of modern democracies and definitely shows its age when it comes to things like this.  If you look at some other democracies there are triggers where the politicians basically all get fired and new elections are held if they deadlock on passing critical bills to keep the government functioning. Well this article is saying it's likely not constitutional, but that doesn't come into play until congress passes it and then someone brings a lawsuit challenging constitutionality. The founding documents of our Constitution were fraught with compromises in order to get all the states on board to begin with, and rely a great deal on the people in office to simply   do things that would break how the process is supposed to work. It's also being done by the people who would have to write and pass the laws that would stop them from doing it, so you can see how that's an issue. 95% of what the US federal government does is unconstitutional if you don't do some twisted mental gymnastic interpretation and read the constitution as it is written. Simple. The legislative branch is allowed to pass essentially whatever they like. If they passed a bill banning the press, it'd be struck down by the courts quickly, but they are still allowed to pass it. Also Trump does tons of stuff \u201cbecause he is president\u201d and no one person technically outranks him. People who should enforce the will of people (Senate) don\u2019t and instead enable him because he represents their party and their wishes. That\u2019s why when they suddenly usher in a new supreme court justice in an election year, they got away with it. With previous presidents they have respectfully given the next president the choice because it\u2019s not appropriate to do it right away. Literally, they pushed for Obama to not name new Supreme Court justice because there was an election coming up in a few months. This one Trump ushered in was considered unqualified and was done during an election. Trump just wants to back the courts with Republicans to keep his agenda as much as he can. Congress loves inflammatory headlines that distract the public from things like this so they can do their business in the dark. Laws only mean anything if they\u2019re enforced. There is so much corruption in our government, due to a variety of weaknesses in our system that were continuously exploited and widened instead of being addressed, that things like \u2018constitutionality\u2019 are often just ignored, and if they get to the Supreme Court, it\u2019s at best a crapshoot whether the judgement will be reasonable or just say that something clearly unconstitutional is ok due to some sort of loophole of conveniently twisted reading of the constitution. oh christmas tree (bill) oh christmas tree (bill), unbalanced are your amendments Someone needs to ram through a bill that states that all laws that are only approved as part of another non-related bill are no longer enforceable. It's in 43 state constitutions. Look up single-subject rule. A single-subject rule amendment to the US constitution is something that has been proposed as early as 1999. Maybe tie it to a stimulus /s So who in Congress introduced the bill? Jeffries, a democrat from NY, introduced this whole bullshit idea under the (extremely false) pretense that it could protect photographers and semi-amateur creators / painters by allowing them to protect themselves in obvious cases of infringement when currently it would be too expensive to press the legal claim. In  , when not abused, this idea has lots of merit. He knew   what he was doing though as did the people who've been pushing this since. Its already hard to stream video game content that has in game music, because even though its part of the game its not your music to stream. I was literally irritated about this exact thing yesterday! I wanted to find a steamers playthrough of a game, but they had to delete all of it because of the fkn music   ... It's crazy. This exact issue happened literally yesterday with the fortnite event thing. My friend had to delete their entire vod and all clips from the stream because Epic Games used copyrighted music in the event. Not just music. The games themselves are copyrighted just the same. Unless you have a license to stream them you can get dmca'd. The problem is most folks don't understand that it is up to the GAME COMPANIES to get the right license to use the music in their games so that it can be streamed without issue. If the game companies do that, then there will be no legit DMCA takedown for the clip. For games that get the proper licenses this isn't an issue. What does keeping the government running have to with completely overhauling the copyright system to enable massive copyright trolling? Disney's, MPAA's and RIAA's pocketbooks. If only Disney tried to write an original thought for once. Why doesn\u2019t anyone overhaul copyright law to prevent abuse? The government isn\u2019t even getting anything from it. FFS...we need to rescind omnibus bills, and go back to individual bill voting. Too many items slip through the sieve of omnibus riders. This is another massive reason our politics are designed to pit us against each other. All of this constant, \"well you voted against XYZ\" when XYZ was included with ABC which has nothing to do with anything else....and more then likely would never even be considered on it's own merit. It really is a joke, and the fact that people are so dogmatic with their politics, really goes to show just how well theyve refined their methods to keep everyone at each others throats.  Wake up people.  Wake up. And before the BS starts, this is not a party specific issue, this is constant within our politics from all angles.  This Is merely an example. This is a party issue though. Dems passed a bill back in the summer that McConnells senate has not taken up. He took the Senate on recess before he even entertained negotiations that weren't needed because the house passed a bill. He and republicans in the Senate are not doing their jobs. They are prioritizing this shit and protection for business over relief and aid for we the people. Our government is far from perfect and Dems have their faults for sure, but when one branch, controlled by one party, fails to do their job on purpose, it absolutely is a specific party problem. It's a Republican-led Senate trying to make changes to the Democratic-led House bill to include this shit, and it would have to be approved by GOP-led White House. Democrats have literally no role in fucking up this bill and there's little they can do to stop the changes, as again anyone with power to make these changes are Republicans. Yet somehow BoTh SiDeS aRe ThE SaMe It comes back to the fact that they don\u2019t represent people, or sometimes even their own opinions.  They represent a party, and will spend all of their time ensuring that the other side doesn\u2019t get anything notable done.  Hence why a two party system(imo) sucks It really isn't a bothsides issue though. This election should've made that abundantly clear to everyone. It's the fucking Republicans plain and simple.  Corporate Dems are corrupt as well, but nowhere near the level of the Republican Party as a whole.  Just look at the bills that the Democratic controlled House has passed, that the vast majority of people want some form of, in which the GOP controlled Senate refuses to even bring to a vote, let alone committee markups. Nah, one side is fucking shit up a lot more. Absolutely correct Actually, the usual reason people are pitted against another is because one side or both sides completely lack critical thinking skills. This is evident with your comment. You did not read the same bill I read. You went off a very short article with outdated information in it, and ran with it. You did not, for one second, question the article you read. People could not be pitted against one another if they are taught to properly evaluate information, and think critically of information they are presented with. And now, because of this error you made, you have added gas to the fire and have worked people up over things that are not true. And this shit happens every day on social media about all manner of shit, and people need to stop. Just stop being an unwitting agent of chaos and misinformation. Holy shit, no one is actually comprehending your comment. Did you know our first past the Post electoral system is mathematically flawed and will always result in a stagnant two party system? It\u2019s capitalism, it\u2019s the utter lack of class consciousness. Yup, empire collapsing due to corruption. This is PURELY republicans. Fuck off with that   bullshit. Both sides are NOT the same. This is absolutely a partisan issue. The only politicians willing to block and stop this stuff are progressive democrats. The parties are NOT the same. \"Congress\" is mentioned as a whole body is attempting to pass this bill... when in reality we are very much aware that it is a specific segment of Congress attempting to pass this bill... I don't know if unconstitutional is the right word for this case, but certainly not something we want passed as is... nor do we want it tied to the spending bill. I mean if you read the article you\u2019d have seen that the bill has bipartisan support. you know the CASE act was introduced by a Democrat, right? Why it may be unconstitutional: Article III vests the judicial power of the United States in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. Consequently, Congress cannot confer the Government\u2019s judicial Power on entities outside Article III. See Greene v. Oil States Energy, decided by a non-partisan majority. Same arguments failed to take down the PTAB. Congress can if it's a voluntary court though. Why the fuck does this process resemble date rape? I am legitimately so fucking done and pissed with copyright all together whether it's the EU's Article 23 reform or the US passing stupid laws to further tighten copyright. To the point were i legitimately pirate everything out of spite for it and to not get abused by either DRM or Terms Of Services. Mmmm gotta love that Christmas pork. Man, I am so tired of Congress being able to slip in amendments to a bill that has absolutely zero to do with the bill. Just so the bill will die in the vote. Wish there were more members of congress willing to make a rule about how bills should only deal with the subject they\u2019re about and not allow amendments that have nothing to do with the bill. This BS tactic of tacking on tons of unrelated things into one huge bill needs to be outlawed. Law student here. This nation\u2019s copyright laws are pretty hot garbage. I\u2019m almost always in favor of any kind of reform that acknowledges computers in meaningful way.  Y\u2019know, something to distinguish between personal use and business use, or maybe something that formalizes or gives end users some right to share altered content, like video gameplay. Current law doesn\u2019t give you the right to share your gameplay (which was not decided by Congress, bur rather courts in caselaw. So Congress could fix it.) Since this doesn\u2019t seem to be it, the search continues... What is the fucking point of Congress? They might as well just do whatever they want. Its clear your people dont matter anymore. Tho it not the whole of Congress. Such and Such Industry purchases congressional favor by spending   amount of money on lobbying Congress adds unconstitutional rider to essential funding bill as a thank you for that sweet, sweet lobbying money Unconstitutional provisions are taken to court to overturn at great expense, costing the challenging citizens and taxpayers an amount of money at least a hundred times more than  .   This money is vacuumed right out of the pockets of John Q Taxpayer, hammering mainly the middle and lower class with yet another needless government expense Industry that caused it sees no repercussions, and actually benefits financially more than they lobbied, because the law was changed; even if it was briefly on a temporary basis they'll likely still come out ahead in the end Rinse and repeat \u221e times Fun fact, there are a total of maybe 60 sound recordings in existence that are in the public domain, and all of them have been in the public domain since their publication (due to being produced by the US military or otherwise exempted from copyright protection). And you can tuck this little factoid in your pocket for the foreseeable future, as not a single sound recording will lapse into the public domain until 2063. We are being scammed out of our cultural birthright by Disney, the big three record labels, and their lobbyists. Why must they try to control every facet of our lives? It's complicated.  But in the end, it is a good thing for people to have copyrights, but where we draw the line is hard.   Like why should I bother inventing a new idea if let's say disney is just gonna copy it, and run me out of business.  It decentivises me from making new intiatives, the last thing you want to do is stop ppl like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos from taking initiative and making more things that are beneficial for society.    On the other hand, it hurts small business too, when those giants can just buy up all the copyrights and prevent others from doing it (China is notorious for doing this, hence why China copyrighted the \"Trump Toilet\" then ransomed it too Trump). Oh look at that. Another bipartisan effort to fuck over the people for special interest groups. Hot damn it's almost like republicans and Democrats are the same people. But we'll just keep voting for them and letting shit like this keep happening. Thing is it likely it does not have bipartisan support to be put into another bill by the backdoor. How many Democrats are pushing to put this into the government appropriations bill? How about you sneak in some FUCKING STIMULUS It's funny how these assholes are always passing or trying to pass shit like this that always end up fucking us the people. We need to invest in guillotines..... This is no surprise, but frankly I'm convinced every copyright law after the Copyright Act of 1909 has been completely unconstitutional since they stifle creation of new works. I've read the bill and I don't find any of the concerns presented to be valid. For starters, BOTH parties have to consent to this court's jurisdiction, and a default judgement is only possible if someone has properly served the other party with the notice and complaint -- and served in the way any other lawsuit would be served. There are large fines applicable to copyright trolls. There is review in the Federal court if there are any shenanigans, and the bad faith actor will have to pay the other's legal expenses. There are two levels of review present in this forum. You can appeal, and if you're denied the right to have your appeal heard, you can appeal that denial as well to a higher level. Read the bill yourselves. I find this techdirt article to be completely misrepresenting how this bill functions. The techdirt article mentions that this sounds like a court under executive power that routes around the judicial branch, which may be unconstitutional, which would be a valid concern, however I'm no lawyer so I'll leave that to professionals. Generally any time the government starts passing copyright legislation it's almost universally awful. Compare to Greene v. Oil States Energy, it's basically the same issue but for patent law and a non-partisan majority upheld the PTAB. Don't consent? You don't get modern media. Do you seriously hear yourself? Most people don't read EULAS or copyright licenses. How bout we stop letting them do this shit? The drivers of these trucks aren't useful assets. The business about it being unconstitutional sounds a lot like the arguments against the PTAB in Greene v. Oil States Energy, and that was a non-partisan majority. I think the Court would allow it (even though I personally disagree with it). Then in 2 years or so when these politicians are up for reelection, their opponents can come out and say \"see my opponent votes for this terrible copyright law\" if they vote for this spending, or \"see my opponent doesn't care about working family's because he voted against the spending bill\" if they vote against it. In these type of situations it's a lose-lose proposition and relies on educated voters to distinguish between letting something bad pass to get something much more important through. But most voters aren't educated and don't follow the news or remember what happened 2 years ago and that's why we are in the mess we are in today. I fucking hate riders. They're blackmail. Welcome to the Untied Corporations of America I just don\u2019t understand how completely unrelated issues can be put on the same bill and voted on together? I\u2019m not American and my political knowledge isn\u2019t extensive but this just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I\u2019m sorry but what\u2019s so bad about this Bill? I looked into it and it really just looks like it\u2019s establishing a small claims board that only exists if both parties agree to have a case heard by it. All it does is establish a \u201ccopyright court\u201d that exists to settle disputes on copyright infringement. The payout is capped at $30,000 so that people won\u2019t get completely destroyed by fees and all court costs have to be paid by the individuals. This actually sounds like it could be a really good thing for small creators to pursue cases of copyright infringement, but since the defendant can opt out and does not actually HAVE to participate I don\u2019t see what\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional\u201d about it The payout is capped at $30,000 so that people won\u2019t get completely destroyed by fees and all court costs have to be paid by the individuals. So i can steal your idea and all i have to pay you is 30k.. Fk you i'm in. Also please share your idea with me.. I will not steal them. Why don\u2019t they just make a law having it be illegal to slip random bs things into a Bill? Dude fuck the rule that allows multiple things to be included in a single bill. Stop this practice of shoving in a little extra foot note on a bill that has nothing to do with the rest of the bill. Copyright has nothing to do with covid relief. The bill should have a \"subject\" and things that fall outside of the subject should get their own bill. How anyone voted for this evil, evil man... blows my mind.  He's not stupid, he's smart ... greedy... and evil. And by \u201cCongress\u201d we of course mean \u201cRepublicans\u201d Can someone eli5 how a bill about something can just contain anything else? Yes, we need to increase the federal school budget by $10 million, and tack on $90 million for weapons for Israel. Ok that's a $100 million education bill. It's just how things been, they are called \"Omnibus Bills\" if you wanna read more. The problem is the US has single.subject rules for state laws, which a number of states use. But that is of course also abused to take down and delay bills that has anything beyond EXACTLY one issue and topic. So I think whatever solution one uses, the politicans will always use them in malice to stall or abuse the system in their favor. This how things have always been.   There is no requirement that all items placed in a bill be related. It's always been wrong, but it serves congresspeople well, so there's never been a serious effort by the legislative branch to reform it. Efforts to curtail it by other branches of government (such as line item vetoes) have been shot down historically as well. Thanks Disney I don't think there's any malintent here, I think there's laziness. Congress knows full well that the act is flawed Constitutionally. They simply want SCOTUS to sort it out for them. This partially due to laziness, again, and unwillingness to hash out the politically touchy issues, but it's also due to a failing in the US court system. Without a case or controversy, US courts can't issue a ruling. Which is to say that you cannot seek an advisory opinion. Correcting the inability to seek an advisory opinion, even on behalf of Congress, would go a long way to improving many aspects of the US' legislative process. Yeah it is pretty crazy how we've ended up in this situation where nobody can ever really know what the constitution says until there's a lawsuit - sort of the opposite of how laws should work. Can someone explain this to me like I'm 5? Can someone ELI5 this for me? I read the article, just a bit confused on it. Not sure what copyright trolling is. This is why I don't like the severability doctrine by SCOTUS. I want to tack on a rider to that bill: $30 million of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts A $30,000 fine that doesn't go through court? That literally life-ending right there. Finally get mr Ashit Pai out of the FCC and now this garbage. The sponsor of this bill Rep Hakeem Jeffries Democrat from New York. Here's an idea, if there's anything in the bill other than giving the American people a NSA cash payment, the bill goes directly into the trash. This continues until these lame brain mouth breathing old bitches can finally learn to follow instructions. Apparently none of them never attended 1st grade. How about someone sneak in a bill that says you can't sneak bills in anymore Surely this has bipartisan support. So politics as usual then. Every politician does this.  Well, kinda. So I guess this will put an end to all of those reaction videos on YouTube. Is this related to the other section 230 story i read today? They sound like different subjects, but the circumstances are the same. (Today, spending bill, section 230) Can I get an unbiased article or ELI5 on this? Hakeem Jeffries [D-NY] and Doug Collins [R-GA] are the lead sponsors in the House, H.R. 2426. You can't get two more polarizing figures in the House yet they could agree on this bill. It passed the House last October, 410-6 which is a very rare instance of a legislative landslide. Then it went to the Senate as S. 1273 where it was hotlined and then held by Sen. Ron Wyden [D-OR]. It has 21 cosponsors in the Senate; 9 D's and 12 R's.  If I remember correctly the idea for the court came from the US Copyright Office about 10 or so years ago. Great Britain has had this style of copyright small claims court for over 6 years now. Of course they are Sounds about right. The US government and 'Doing The Right Thing' go together like oil and water. does their National anthem still has the words \"the land of the free\" in it? I think as an american I would throw up a bit into my mouth if i had to sing that part. Fa la la la la, la la la la Congress and pork barreling: name a better duo Unfortunately what your saying is considered true, but today's times have dictated that truth is no longer important.  Therefore social media companies have now become publishers whether they like it or not. Our country as a whole no longer believes in anything factual or true, just opinion.  Washington D.C. doesn't like the power Big Tech has so regardless of what you or I think, they will get their agenda done one way or another. Block it, fuck them. Let's tear down this shit government, they aren't working for us anymore. I gotta say, it\u2019s really stupid that American lawmakers get to just put whatever the hell legislation they want on a totally unrelated bill. If an idea needs to be snuck into another bill it\u2019s probably not worth having. This is how neoliberals operate. They say what they feel they need to in order to win their elections. After the election, they couldn\u2019t care less about their voters wishes and work to pass whatever they\u2019ve been lobbied to pass. They love sneaking unpopular legislation in like this when they know they can\u2019t pretend it would be good for anyone but the select few that fund their super pacs. You aren\u2019t wrong but republicans do the same thing. Both parties are wicked corrupt. Can everyone in this thread accept that our government on both sides is constantly trying to fuck us over? There's a few on each side who aren't, but fuck me the rest must hate us. No, republicans absolutely do it more than democrats. Democrats do it too, but republicans do it much, much worse. Dont reduce this to such a simple dichotomy. It's not that. Case in point: Democrats want to give more people healthcare, Republicans want to take it away. Its night and day Lets be clear here...its not 'congress' its 'Republicans' \"big daddy democrat government wouldn't fuck me over \" lol Lets be clear here..    You are completely fucking wrong, the entire idea was the child of a Democrat (Jeffries, from NY), and it has already been overwhelmingly supported in the past by the House (410-6 vote) woops. Generic Democrats are assholes too. Should have voted for more Bernie Sanders/AOC's. Congress? So both the Republicans and Democrats are trying to do this? No? Then fucking call it out. So both the Republicans and Democrats are trying to do this? Yes. Members of both parties supports this authoritarian bullshit. No? What do you mean \"No\"?. I JUST fucking said YES. Were you just ASSUMING it was only the Big Bad R, you partisan hack? Bullets are going to start flying. I\u2019m so fucking sick of this shit Hahahahaha; voted for Biden, got punch with both a Left and Right fist! The fuck are you on about? Biden hasn't even been sworn in yet. There is much complaining about the president, but I feel the real problem exists with our congress. Except this was the brainchild of a democrat from NY. Biased redditor pushing nonsense narrative at it again. Mental scenes By congress they mean senate right? This piece of joy was originally passed 410 - 6 in the democrat led House. It was thought up by a NY democrat. Can't just blame pubs this time. Oh boy... how bad is it? Or we could, ya know, not pass it. If the Republicans want to play this whole \"our way or the highway\" bullshit I am perfectly fine to call their bluff and let this whole place burn. Fuck it. It's not just republicans.  And if it wasn't for Nancy playing the \"my way or the highway\" act since August, we would have  had a stimulus package signed....   It's been absolutely ridiculous, they were more concerned about not giving Trump a win, then the American people.  Trump even said to Nancy, and publically.   Get the bill to maximum 2 trillion, and \"I will get the republicans on board\".   Bitch refused to go below 2.2 trillion....  Like fucking 200 billion really?  Fucking really?  That's what you were upset about? Ughh our politicians piss me off. The sponsor of this bill is a New York Democrat in the Democrat controlled House but nice try You should probably look into this topic if you feel so strongly. The Democrat party is the Party of Wall Street at this point, not the Republicans (I'm independent) Surprise surprise.. more big name Democrats cosponsoring absolutely inane technology-related bills. Wow.  The bill hasn't even passed yet, and Reddit censors this article from me when I log in.  I literally had to open reddit in a new browser, see this article, then log in on another browser to make this comment. that's not how any of this works Try following the multiple links in the article to previous coverage of the situation. For crying out loud, I can't even come to   without a tribal political fight. I'm going to end up unsubscribe to everything Is this really tribal? Who's on the other side of this besides some lobbyists for big content? Social media of any kind has blocked free speech This again? Private companies are not the government. You\u2019re free to start your own social media company. Thats what freedom of speech is. You\u2019re not obligated to supply anyone else\u2019s speech through your company. If they don\u2019t like it, they too can start their own social media company. Do you understand now? You should maybe look up what \u201cfree speech\u201d actually means.

{"Mick Schumacher to race for Haas in 2021 as famous surname returns to the F1 grid.": ["We created a Discord server for our community and would like to invite all of you to join! You'll be able to discuss sports with users around the world and discuss events in real time! There are separate channels for many sports you can opt in and out of, including; American Football, Soccer, Baseball, Basketball, Aussie Rules Football, Rugby Union and League, Cricket, Motorsports, Fitness, and many more. I hope as fans we can let him grow into the sport and not just put him on an immediate pedestal that he feels he needs to live up to because of the reputation that his name brings. He's still going to be an F1 rookie and he's still human. And he's at Haas. Results will be delayed, to put it mildly. To put it less mildly, he'll be lucky if his brakes fail only once next season I have witnessed the hype Mick already was in his F3 days. No, they will hype it up in F1 even more. Villeneuve didn\u2019t take long I think that\u2019s what happened with Sebastian Vettel. People wanted a Schumacher 2.0. I hope as fans we can let him grow into the sport and not just put him on an immediate pedestal You must be new here. Seeing his name on a Haas car is going to do plenty to temper expectations. Next year will mostly be a test to see if the problem was the drivers or if it was management. Same.  I am concerned they are promoting him up for ratings and $ due to the attraction of his name.  He has had a couple good years in F2 and F3.  Just hope it is not too soon for the driving and the pressure. Ahhh. To go back to a time when we could all be just human Verstappen, another second generation f1 driver, won his inaugural race and has become one of the most formidable drivers in the field in a very short time. I feel like the grid is near half made up of famous surnames nowadays In 2001, we had Verstappen, Schumacher, Raikkonen and Alonso on the grid. Next year we have Verstappen, Schumacher, Raikkonen and Alonso on the grid. Verstappen is the son of a former F1 driver. Same as Mick. And then Sainz is the son of a famous rally driver. It's getting hereditary. F1 kids: I want to be an artist F1 Parents: You will learn the family trade and that is final!! Yeah because the sport is so hard to get into. The main reason Albon drives under the Thai flag instead of the British is because his Thai sponsors are the only reason he's an F1 driver at all. You need money and connections from a young age to be an F1 driver, it's no wonder Seen Lauda\u2019s kid and Senna\u2019s nephew run the circuits in IMSA a couple years ago. no kidding He actually raced before f3 with his mother\u2019s name so he could turn away the publicity, also he doesn\u2019t want to Be compared to his father Real shame he\u2019s gotta drive for haas tho.  That teams been a dumpster fire the past couple seasons But you never know with F1. Last year Racing Point finished 7th in the constructor championship and was considered a mid-field team at best. Then this year they are consistently getting points and even managed to get two podiums, almost three if Checo's car hadn't blow up in the final laps of Bahrain. Maybe Haas manages to build an amazing car out of the blue for 2021. That teams been a dumpster fire Very much so! I know that would make his dad proud. Just checked his progress and it made me tear up. So many years living so dangerously and the furthest thing from ones\u2019 imagination happens. Young Schumacher has some shoes to fill, and I bet he will come close at a minimum. No pressure or anything. Lots of drivers have looked competitive in the lower formulas, and then gone on to do very little in F1. Frentzen and Schumacher Sr were rivals in lower formula with many considering Frentzen to be the quicker driver. Look what happened when they both got to F1. You need a lot of things to fall into place to become F1 champion. He\u2019ll have a lot of pressure because he\u2019s expected to deliver. He\u2019ll have to handle that. Just read up on his dad's progress. Jeez, he is still making progress 7 years after his accident. Hope he continues to improve. Please enlighten me: what has happened with Michael Schumacher? Did he wake up from the coma? Is still in it? As best as I can tell he is not in a coma anymore....several people have said they have spoke with him....however his condition is always described as being very delicate (paraphrasing)....which leads me to believe that he is probably not ambulatory and not very responsive unfortunately (but that\u2019s just my opinion) The family is very secretive about it. And he made no public appearances since the accident. I guess he is in some kind of vegetative state. Meanwhile Perez ( Top 5 pilot imo) will have no team next year. Didn't think that was settled yet. Still possible he could slot in at RedBull He was in beast mode in Bahrain, was fun to watch. He could still go to RB. Top 5 pilot imo No he is not lol With a complete human garbage of a team mate. Whats wrong with Nikita Mazepin? i dont know much about him. Lets not jump to conclusions. Yes things that are out there about him dont make look too great, but maybe f1 will make him mature since he will be among the best of the best. I've been so behind F1 for too many years now, I thought this is the older Schumacher and wondered for a few seconds, how Michael did not age a day. Thankfully I read the article. But really, how does Michael have a 21 y.o. son already? Update: just checked, he's now 51! How time flies. Netflix has a great series on the 2018 and 2019 seasons if you want to catch up Unfortunately he had a terrible accident a few years ago while skiing and suffered a horrible neurological injury. He likely doesn\u2019t know Mick will be racing in F1 or can\u2019t comprehend. Terrible terrible. Haas is the Cleveland Browns of F1. Change my mind. The Browns are actually doing well this season. They're going to be shit for 20 years then start winning? Hmm, yes. Thats some big shoes to fill! Uncle Ralf set quite the benchmark Lol, I love everybody complaining about nepotism  having no idea that Mick is a former F3 Champion and is leading the F2 Championship. Plenty of undeserving drivers have been given seats, but Mick is not one of them. Of course his family name and money probably helped along the way, but that shouldn\u2019t count against his success What ever happened to Ralf.. Still alive and well. Just has never had an F1 seat since 2007. Would be cool if his son made it to F1, Mick and him were the first cousins in F1! His thumbs look so weird in that picture and I can\u2019t get over it I alway has a driver who last name is Schumacher! Netflix drive to survive gonna be thicc with drama despite not having many race to follow Any idea when the next season comes out? It\u2019s happening! wtf is happening with his dad? havent heard any news in years i think the family is super private about affairs. Probably a vegetable or severely incapacitated.  It's been many years since the accident and they have not let even a picture of him come out, or at least that I'm aware of. Totally outrageous that Perez has no seat, but this guy gets to race.  He\u2019s not the famous Schumacher. love it. hate that he has to team up with that entitled douche. keep laughing today thinking about yoda nutting for the first time in 500 years and immediately he starts talking regular again I follow F1 somewhat, but I don't follow the upcoming drivers, anyone who follows, how much of this is deserved and how much of it is because his last name is schumacher? Let's take up a pool, how many races till Lando slams into him? Did Michael ever recover from his ski accident?  Is he still alive? Ngl....I read that as Michael Schumacher to return to F1 and nearly jumped off my chair. Thought I was dreaming. I hope Mick gets all the success he deserves :) I heard this today on the radio The lady very kindly pointed out \"Mick is the son of Michael Schumacher\" So glad she did as I'd never have figured that out for myself Hope he is nicer to the sport than his dad was. Explain I\u2019m new to f1 Maybe they can come fix our multiple Haas CNC drills that have been down for two weeks FAST. He's winning f2 this year, so it's not like he's there just because of who his father is You mean Damon Hill the son of Graham Hill? Even Lewis Hamilton\u2019s half brother is racing in BTCC. However he never seems to finish a race. I must say Nicholas Hamilton does have cerebral palsy. I think it\u2019s wonderful to have someone with such disability compete in motorsport. I just can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s only because of his famous name that he has been given the opportunity. That was several years ago. Bruno Senna raced from 2010-2012, but he never drove for a particularly good team. He\u2019s now having some success in the World Endurance Championship Edit: I was reminded that he did in fact score points, mostly in the Williams in 2012 Anyone ever notice in 'The Expanse' Alex, the pilot, calls Holden \"Haas\" several times. Is this the source of the expression? Hoss is a slang word for horse. Basically calling the person big, strong, and dependable. He's leading the F2 championship. The soccer fandom is leaking Nepotism doesn't explain away an F3 championship and a current lead in the F2 championship. Both are spec series, so driver skill shines through way more. Yes being the son of one of the greatest drivers of all time gave him opportunities, but opportunities don't mean shit without talent and hard work, especially given modern super license requirements Mick Schumacher is literally leading F2. Out of junior drivers he is literally the best. He's leading the f2 championships which is a feeder to f1. Yes he's had the advantage of being born to a successful father, but he's actually a very good driver. Yes, it\u2019s true that having that surname will bring sponsors and contacts, but the guy is good. Same thing happened with Verstappen, he\u2019s the son of a F1 driver, but he\u2019s probably the best/2nd best driver in the grid. If your father is short, has good reflexes and amazing hand eye coordination, you probably will have that too. If you add this to his experience helping you grow as a driver, you can see that this is a great advantage. Is F1 not a sport? Go for a lap in one of those beasts and then come back and tell us if it\u2019s a sport... your neck will fall off after the first turn. ", "Sports"], "Topic": "Sports"},
{"Megathread: Attorney General Barr: No Widespread Election Fraud": ["Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. His comments come despite President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claims that the election was stolen, and his refusal to concede his loss to President-Elect Joe Biden. In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr said U.S. Attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they\u2019ve received, but they\u2019ve uncovered no evidence that would change the outcome of the election. Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis say this: \"With all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation.\" Dropping their allies quicker than hair dye on a gremlin face. I love that Trump is going out with this long, excruciating whimper instead of a bang. Not with a bang but with a WI/MI/PA On Parler, Bill Mitchell calls Bill Barr \u201ca deep state snake and Bush plant.\u201d These people are completely insane. It tracks though, the fight has now shifted against long time establishment Republicans. It's Trump's final consolidation of power, to officially turn it into his party. Why does Trump keep hiring Deep State people who a fighting against him?  Amazing isn't it. On Parler LOL If anyone was actually part of an illegal shadow government meant to subvert democracy, it was Bill Barr. Right for the wrong reasons? Kaitlan Collins from CNN is on Twitter about this.. After telling the Associated Press there is no evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of the election, Attorney General Bill Barr just arrived at the White House Then Wow. Rudy Giuliani & Jenna Ellis going after Barr, saying \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation...Again, with the greatest respect to the Attorney General, his opinion appears to be without any knowledge or investigation.\u201d Edit: except he did have prosecutors looking at it. Article a couple weeks old.. Prosecutors assigned to investigate baseless allegations of irregularities in vote tallies told Attorney General William Barr that they found no \"substantial irregularities,\"\u00a0 The AP article that broke this story also specifically says that the FBI has been, and continues to investigate the allegations of fraud: Barr said U.S. attorneys and FBI agents have been working to follow up specific complaints and information they\u2019ve received, but they\u2019ve uncovered no evidence that would change the outcome of the election. \u201cMost claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations and. And those have been run down; they are being run down,\u201d Barr said. \u201cSome have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.\u201d Apparently there was no meeting scheduled either, he was summoned.  Barr's definitely getting screamed at right now.  Damn Rudy and Jenna are deep in character for the panto. Is it money or blackmail? \"There\u2019s a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don\u2019t like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and \u2018investigate,\u2019\u201d Barr said. Pretty fucking rich coming from the dude who has done exactly that for Trump since the start of his tenure as AG. They're beginning the true transition: making sure the incoming Dems are immediately under fire by criticizing the things the GOP has been doing without shame. \"Increasingly, the tendency...\" means \"when the Dems use the DOJ to prosecute federal crimes we will bring this up.\" Never forget that Bill Barr is a lawless, corrupt hack who politicized the DOJ, and actively tried to suppress democracy in subservience to the most corrupt president this nation has ever seen Bill Barr legitimately believes the President should have absolute authority and freedom from consequences. Fuck Bill Barr. Barr is evil but not stupid. He knows which way the wind is blowing. He has survived many years in the Republican Party... he follows the power not the man. He's going to lose the AG position, and it's not like Trump can do anything else for him now. He was brought in at the tail end of GHWB's presidency to facilitate the pardons and cover-ups. He knows that every minute wasted on Trump's election ranting is a minute that needs to be spent preparing to avoid consequences. Brian Kemp, Dou Docey and now Bill Barr?! ALL DEEP STATE OPERATIVES See Republicans...does your vote even count anymore in a rigged election? Stay home for the runoffs and stick it to the libs! How long before Trump fires him on Twitter? I\u2019m betting before the end of tomorrow night When it shows up on OANN he'll tweet it. Right now it's showing hearings, and he's sitting on his butt watching tv. Edit: a local tv station link:  I guess Barr is a liberal activist antifa plant? In the mob, he's a rat Ha. Like that time Gym Jordan called John Roberts a liberal activist judge in a House committee meeting. I\u2019ve watched so much fucking CSPAN over the last 12 months I can\u2019t remember on what occasion he said it. I\u2019ve popped into   several times lately just to try and get perspective. They really think there\u2019s tons of voter fraud evidence hidden under a mattress somewhere in central PA. It\u2019s an interesting corner of reddit, to say the least. When people are quoting Veritas articles as evidence \ud83d\ude2c According to Jim Acosta, Barr literally arrived at the WH a couple of minutes ago One theory is that Mitch sent him over to have a little chat about Trump shutting up, especially about Georgia. Or Barr's newly revealed special counsel will turn up some evidence about the   origins of the Russia investigations. This just in: Barr recants claim the DOJ and FBI did not identify fraud.  Says a lot of fraud was found but he can\u2019t show us because it\u2019s top secret. All websites: Barr says no election fraud. Fox news website: Barr hasn't found election fraud yet! lol, thought you were joking, but that's their headline \"  to find widespread voter fraud\" Here are the most likely outcomes here. Trump has taken more Xanax then Adderall today. Barr resigns in 72 hours to \"spend more time with his children and grandchildren\". Donald Trump never speaks of him again. Trump has taken more Adderall than Xanax. The insane tweet storm begins at some point between 10pm -2am tonight. Xanax then Adderall Accurate I'll take Insane Tweet Storms for $100, Alex. Also breaking... Barr tries to cover his backside a bit: Attorney General William Barr has given extra protection to the prosecutor he appointed to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, giving him the authority of a special counsel to complete his work without being easily fired. He gave Durham special counsel authority Durham's investigation isn't going to find anything earth shattering and it's likely the new AG will just let it conclude with a whimper. Alternatively, the new AG can just change the scope of the investigation. This move does almost nothing to protect Barr's personal witch hunt. Guess who doesn't want to go to jail like Nixon's AG did... For dumb, gullible rubes who are all deathly terrified of socialism, conservatives sure love getting publicly owned. lol we gonna get AG Giuliani The thought of that makes me vomit a little out my scalp. Now I\u2019m suddenly worried there might have been pro-GOP election fraud. You mean, other than crippling the USPS, shutting down polling locations and giving a wink to right wing extremist groups hell bent on disrupting voters and vote counters for over a week? edit - yes, the fake drop boxes, which the CA(?) GOP admitted to Honestly, it'd give me hope for the US if there was fraud that made it as close as it was. However, listening to my co-workers there wasn't that much. He's saying they found no evidence of fraud because the GOP was committing a lot of fraud, voter suppression and encouraging election day disruption. First the Trump sycophants turned on Fox News when they called Arizona for Biden, calling them \"traitors\". Newsmax has recently been given the same treatment for reporting states certifying their votes for Biden. I have no doubt they'll label Barr the same after this. If your \"metric\" for   is whatever your idol states rather than objective fact, then you're a member of a cult. Really hope they just have to keep boycotting themselves into complete social isolation. Just Trump and what he sends out on Parler. The only safe spaces that will be left after January. lmao now im 100% sure there was pro-gop fraud Lol.  True. I mean they basically disenfranchise people in broad daylight, they just have the power to do it. Its unethical, but unfortunately legal. This is damage control. They\u2019re realizing this whole gambit has backfired in a big fucking way in GA. There\u2019s an outright rebellion brewing in GOP voters because they all think the election is all bullshit. They tried so hard to disenfranchise dem voters that they ended up disenfranchising their own. The definition of stupidity. All that being said, if you live in GA, please for all that is kind and good in this world, vote. Don't assume this stuff means it isn't going to be an incredibly close race. Soros just informed me that since we got to Barr all drinks at cabal holiday parties will be free. Cool cause I saved up all my Soros Bucks for a cool antifa hat! They are NOT HAPPY with Barr on Parler: Parler is officially imploding over Bill Barr. #bushplant \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f They're fucking insane. Can you give me a few more examples.... I\u2019m close ;-@ MSNBC right now is reporting that apparently Hannity said Trump should pardon himself and his whole family. Now, you gotta wonder,  Biased Barr was a low level employee in the Trump administration, and he was not up to the job. That's why I am firing him and replacing him with Rudy. Trump in a tweet, in 15 minutes Looks like the real voter fraud was all the friends we made along the way. R/conservative already crying about brigading and libs coming to rub it in so mods insta flaired the post lol. For people laughing at the left and libs for being snowflakes, they really love being in their safe space and holding each other's hands over reality hitting them. Can't wait for the right to fully disown him. Boy anyone know who \u201cRemoved By Moderator\u201d is? He sure is posting a lot in the conservative threads the trump legal team is mad Barr can't back them up \ud83d\ude02\ud83c\udf7f Just in: A hopeful Rudy Giuliani, who thinks he might become Acting AG if Bill Barr is fired, is currently experiencing chafing after spending the last few hours \"adjusting his microphone.\" Two conservatives died and went to Heaven. They were greeted by God at the pearly gates. Seeking truth, one of the conservatives asked God, \u201cGod, we must know... Was there fraud during the 2020 U.S. presidential election?\u201d God said to the man, \u201cNo, the election was fair and Joe Biden won by a landslide.\u201d The conservative then turned to his friend and said, \u201cWow... the deep-state goes much higher than we thought.\u201d In future news: Attorney General William Barr fired. What a creative way to announce your resignation. Even Barr can\u2019t back up this batshit crazy conspiracy theory. Lol Is this the kraken or Hear me out guys, this is actually genius. First lose all your court cases, next prove no voter fraud by either federal or state investigation....then badda-bing badda-boom Trump is President for life. Q told me. -  probably It will truly be a blessed day when I never have to care about any of these abominable fascist dipshits ever again unless they're being charged with felonies and imprisoned. For those who missed it under the statement, Barr also placed Durham in charge of a Special Counsel investigation into the Mueller Report's origins today.  This guarantees that there will be a (GOP/Barr DOJ) SC investigation much like Mueller's running during Biden's term. Barr is still a massive conniving GOP animal. Firing in 3... 2... He was summoned to the WH 30min ago You know you're fucked when you've lost the support of Bill Barr. They tried so hard They went so far In the end It didn't even matter I like how Trump supporters are acting like Barr is some part of a deeper conspiracy. It can't be that Trump is full of shit and is only crying \"voter fraud\" because that's what he does literally any time he loses an election (like when Cruz beat him in Iowa in 2016 or when he lost the popular vote in 2016), literally everyone is conspiring against Trump. Dude is a giant man-baby incapable of handling losing, and you're a bunch of chums for believing him over literally everyone else saying \"yeah, he's full of shit\". Edit: and if you want receipts for that claim about Trump's fraud claims, here you go: Lmao will conservatives now turn on Barr and call him a deep state communist, Marxist, socialist, Democrat? He's literally Trump's right hand man. This is how the Trump ends. Not with a bang, but a shitload of impotent whining. Oh no. Anyway.. I was told there would be Krakens unleashed and things would get Biblical... I texted my dad this. His response? \"Think with your ears, not with your eyes\" No wonder Republicans are so confused. We think with our brains Your dad is in a cult. What the fuck does that even mean? Lol R/Conservative really be saying that Barr has always worked against Trump LOL Joe Biden is president elect \ud83d\ude0e This is actually funny as fuck lmao Wow. The deep-state even got to Barr! /s Incoming \u201cBill Barr is the worst AG in the history of the world\u201d tweet Conservatives already disowning him on Parler this is hilarious THAT'S IT! I'm definitely boycotting the Georgia run-offs now. Us conservatives need to stick together and support Trump no matter what. You guys with me? I fully support you in this decision 100% write trump in and own a lib! He is going to be fired Friday and the fascist lawyer Joe DiGenova will take his place.. And the thread for this on   has already been removed.  Sad. Edit:   Hey, they need their safe spaces. What\u2019s funny is, now when people cry voter fraud, you can literally point a finger and say \u201cTrump\u2019s own Attorney General found no evidence of fraud\u201d and it still won\u2019t matter to them. Guys he has a blue mask!! Blue = Democratic = Socialist = Communist Coincidence? I think not!! gradually watching another repub turn their back on Trump daily is just.... I can only get so erect.. \"I never liked Barr. I barely knew him. I didn't even hire him.\" -- Donald Trump probably I hopped on FOX News' YouTube channel and saw that the Right is now calling Barr a Democrat-plant. You can't make this shit up Sidney Powell has just offered an affidavit from Ron Watkins -   - as evidence in her Georgia lawsuit. Watching conservatives turn on Barr is going to be so glorious to watch \"You can't tell me there is no fraud when I'm watching it live on OAN with my own eyes!\" God my part of the country is the fucking worst.  everybody... Fraud does not equal impropriety. Sometimes it\u2019s not about what is said but what is not said. Rats fleeing a sinking ship there will be no evidence of him having a job soon I mean at this point he is part of the swamp... Always was Liar Lou Dobbs absolutely loses it over Bill Barr saying there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud, accusing Barr of joining \"the Deep State and the Resistance\" before saying this: \"He is either a liar or a fool or both. He may be \u2013 perhaps compromised.\" Lol they're nuts! He didn\u2019t watch that one video I saw on YouTube. I\u2019ll try to find it but it proves deep state soros commie chavez voter fraud. They're trying to get people back in line in Georgia. Nothing more. After the election Barr will probably start it up again, but from his living room. Rudy is   at the thought of being the next AG In other news, President Trump announces on Twitter that Attorney General William Barr is fired. Later today: I NEVER LIKED DEEP STATE NEVER TRUMPER BILLY BUMBLARR So Barr was part of the deep state all along?! /s (sadly, necessary) AG Barr jumping from a sinking ship.. how predictable. It's funny that you could scarcely imagine a more craven republican bootlicker than Barr, who defended Trump at almost every turn and even gassed protestors in Washington for Trump's bible photo-op, and deployed federal agents to protestors in portland and other cities. Yet even Barr is somehow disloyal now... these people are truly pathetic Trump\u2019s assertions are   based in rigorous facts and a value for truth. Rather, they are based on feelings and his value of himself. If something is perceived by Trump to be personally beneficial, he will infamously exclaim it is the greatest thing to ever happen in the world. Conversely, If something is felt by Trump to be personally threatening, then he will relentlessly attack it as fake, a fraud, or rigged. When running for the Republican Party nominee in 2016, Trump rejected the results of the Iowa caucuses, asserting based on no evidence whatsoever: \u201cTed Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!...Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.\u201d Before the 2016 general election, polls estimated Trump had about a 30% chance of beating Clinton. So he again, without any evidence, relentlessly exclaimed that \u201cThis election is absolutely being rigged\u2026\u201d In 2016, Trump indeed lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly three million votes. Yet he won the Electoral College. But he used the platform of the Presidency to attack: \u201cIn addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" Trump has repeatedly stated and implied that three to five million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. In 2017, Trump instigated after the fact the creation of a Voter Fraud investigation to discover evidence supporting his claims. Because he did not have any evidence supporting his claims when he made them. He merely felt election fraud was true. The opposite proposition, that he was unpopular, was threatening. Eight months later this investigation was quietly shut down without remotely justifying Trump\u2019s wild conspiracy theories of election fraud. In 2020, with the country fighting the Covid-19 epidemic, States began preparing for the election. There existed broad anticipation for large numbers of mail-in-votes, especially from urban areas badly affected by the virus. So Trump began attacking the USPS, attempting to defund it and cripple its operation while more broadly attacking the election process. \u201cNow [Democrats] need that money in order to have the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots\u2026 If we don\u2019t make a deal that means they don\u2019t get the money. That means they can\u2019t have universal mail in voting. It just can\u2019t happen.\u201d Trump, Fox Business Interview Trump suddenly installed a loyalist donor with no credible experience as Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy DeJoy implemented sweeping changes to USPS operations, firing postal officials, reducing workers hours, and eliminating sorting machines, causing a widespread slowdown of the service. Meanwhile, Trump began falsely campaigning that votes not received and counted by election day were invalid. Trump publicly called for his \u201csupporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully.\u201d This is one of many examples of his unAmerican voter intimidation tactics. Trump publicly demanded the DOJ arrest his opponent, Presidential nominee Joe Biden, based on propaganda sourced back to Rudy Giuliani and Russian disinformation. (It is not yet clear if he also privately asked the AG Willaim Barr to do this.) On election night, far before the votes were counted but just as had been leaked to be his intention weeks prior, Trump declared victory! Despite losing, Trump declared himself the winner of the election; he demanded that votes stop being counted where he was winning and that only Rrepublican votes continue to be counted where he was losing; and he simultaneously celebrated the broad down ballot success of the Republican party while asserting that those very same ballots which equally broadly did not vote for him were fraudulent. This malicious, tin-pot dictator assault on our institution of democracy is unprecedented. And it is perhaps the most fundamentally destabilizing attack against the U.S. since the Confederate rebellion. Neither Pearl Harbor nor 9/11 ever realized the chance of so basically upsetting our society and government. Trump did not have evidence of fraud when he told the world the election was rigged and that he instead won in 2020. And he is tearing the U.S. apart, destroying the   established norm of a peaceful transition of power so to seek the resemblance of any such evidence. All because the election results are a threat to him and his corrupt legal immunity as President. Fuck Trump and Fuck you Trump Supporters. Every single one of y'all are \ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude02 Ok I have two theories on this: the DID find large amounts of fraud but it turns out that it\u2019s all fraud against Biden, not for him Or even Barr is too scared to get sucked into what ever coup attempt trump is trying and is trying to get himself fired before Jan 20 \"Wow, now so called AG Billy Barr stating that there is no fraud, even though ALL know that there is HUGE FRAUD! What is he afraid of? Why such bias in Department of \"J\" against your favorite president, me? Sad!\" - future Trump tweet Attorney General William Barr said his department had found no evidence of the widespread voter fraud Trump alleges, while Rudolph Giuliani vowed to continue his search. His  . Hahaha. It's been a month since the election Rudy, I don't think you're supposed to be searching at this point. But by all means keep looking - maybe you'll find a leprechaun or your long lost dignity. I'll put $10 down saying Trump will shortly go on a tirade about Barr being \"unfit to serve\" and calling for his disbarment. Barr is a liberal plant, I heard it on ONN and Trump told me so in my sleep. He comes to me when I'm on my knees in my dreams I can't wait for what Trump tweets about this. I love to see these asshats eat each other Lmao this is how he gets fired right? Looks like part of Trump's tantrum response is now  . I'm sure Biden is heartbroken to not have to spend time with the overgrown toddler. \u201cWith all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn\u2019t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation. We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined. We have many witnesses swearing under oath they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter fraud. As far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the DOJ. The justice department also has an audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth.\u201d Trumps legal team Looks like they\u2019re going to keep crying \u201cWAIT FOR THE EVIDENCE\u201d and never actually bringing anything forward. Barr even shot down the Bogus Dominion Conspiracy Theory, specifically. From the \u201cAP\u201d article: Barr didn\u2019t name Powell specifically but said: \u201cThere\u2019s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything to substantiate that,\u201d Barr said. Expecting Barr to be fired by the end of the week now. No mass arrests, and now this?!?! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Barr's always been a liberal hack. /s He's a piece of shit.  He has done, and can do, a lot for the corrupt as fuck GOP.  But there are still probably some things he can't do it seems. A part of me hopes he gets fired in a real nasty way. I went to see Trump's reaction but he is too busy with some whisleblower conference.  I checked it out, and oh boy, it is idiotic.  Some postal contractor drove a truck with possible ballots in it (of course they are saying upwards of 288,000 but I am sure it is a small fraction of that).  He claims the truck disappeared after he delivered it.  Yeah, someone probably moved it to where it was needed.  Another one is a person claiming to overhear about backdating ballots, and of course postal workers with \"odd behaviors.\"  Who buys this shit?  This isn't whistleblowing.  This is a bunch of idiots making massive leaps in logic, and they aren't insiders.  They have no knowledge of anything.  Just random hearsay and conjecture based on bullshit.  It makes me sick that this kind of shit it trotted out there and people buy into it. edit:  I forgot the other one, a guy who was using a flash drive on some voting machine.  Mind you the person making the claims knows nothing about computers and jumped to all kinds of weird conclusions.  It is insanity. Barr will be fired before the week is out, if not the day. The MAGA idiots will all claim he's part of the \"DEEP STATE\" even though they were his cheerleaders until today. YES! Now Trump will predictably turn on his lackey Barr. Hysterical. Can't wait to watch this shitshow. Great, now it makes ME question the validity of the election results. Fuck off, Barr! Are Conservatives calling Barr a deep state liberal shill yet? Tomorrow\u2019s news: Barr fired by tweet The lesson the GOP will take from this election is that it\u2019s easier to manipulate the vote before than election than after. Expect some insane levels of voter suppression. Can we consider this official notification from Barr that The coup has failed and there will be no Imperial Republican Presidency possible, Barr has milked his position as much as possible without hazarding prison time, and Barr is fine with being fired by Tweet, today. This is strategic. Barr's allegiance has never been to Trump personally, but to the rigid Judeo-Christian moral code that he believes our society is moving away from. His ass came out of retirement to carry water from Trump because Trump was enthusiastically fearmongering with considerable success among the sort of people Barr believes need protecting - white Christians. They wanted the same people up in arms about the same things for entirely different reasons. Barr has protected Trump's ass this whole time because he believed he had a moral and religious obligation to do so, if you can believe that. He will happily slink away back into the shadows now that his useful idiot has been disposed of. Like rats fleeing the sinking ship. They'll all start to distance themselves now. Standing by for a tweet exclaiming how Barr is a criminal and trump had never even met the guy Incoming from the coping maga crowd. \"Bill Barr is a pedo, Q has the proof!\", \"Bill Barr was paid by Soros!\" and you know all the standard stuff they do. Also Trump never met Barr. Boy will Barr be surprised to find out that he is a nasty liberal socialist ", "Politics"], "Topic": "Politics"},
{"Megathread: Justice Department Investigating Potential Presidential Pardon Bribery Scheme": ["The Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House or related political committee in exchange for a presidential pardon, according to court records unsealed Tuesday in federal court. I'm not shocked about the bribery. I am shocked the DoJ is investigating. They're probably just angry at the lowball bribe amount This comment will likely get buried since it\u2019s so late but there\u2019s an important element here that people are missing. Barr does not have complete control over every single thing that happens at the DOJ. Yes he\u2019s the head, but if he interfered in every single investigation that Trump wanted him to, he\u2019d have a mutiny on his hands as his entire department would quit on him. The DOJ has a very long history of operating as independently as possible and the career prosecutors and investigators that work for or with the DOJ take that very seriously. Barr has absolutely pushed for bullshit investigations, and he\u2019s definitely influenced some to end early (like the Mueller investigation). But he can\u2019t stop every single investigation. He just can\u2019t. Not while maintaining any semblance of authority within his department. In fact it seems to have gotten to the point that some parts of the DOJ are already more or less mutinying against him in their own quiet respectful ways. Some groups like the SDNY within the DOJ appear to be insisting that they continue to investigate what they believe is worth investigating, regardless of what Barr and Trump think. And their challenge to Barr is basically \u201cif you want me to stop investigating Trump and his businesses, you\u2019ll have to fire me.\u201d  And Barr has fired some people. But the investigations don\u2019t stop because they just get handed off to someone else. Barr would have to burn the department to the ground firing everyone all the way down to the mail clerks before he\u2019d actually get those investigations to stop. He has generally found it easier to try to delay those investigations rather than stop them outright. The institutions that our country is built on are robust and are damned hard to get rid of in 4 years. The damage done to them is going to take a long time to fix, but Trump never stood a chance of completely uprooting them. He lacked the know-how and the popular will of the people. Probably just investigating to find no wrong doing so that when biden gets in he can't reopen a new investigation without looking bad politically This case is from August. The judge gave 90 days for the administration to respond, since it\u2019s been 90 days, it\u2019s released now. Flynn? This is a major scandal that should've leaked during the election. When was Glislaine Maxwell arrested again? This is fucking insane. We\u2019re so incredibly lucky all these people are fucking morons. Can you imagine how fucked we'd be if they had any kind of competence?  I feel like I, personally, could have done a better job at doing or covering up any of these schemes, lawsuits or scandals lol Trump is claiming fake news but the news report doesn't even claim he did anything. So ya, he definitely did something. Kind of like when he said his visit to Walter Reed was definitely not for mini strokes when no one asked or said anything about mini strokes? The fraud is coming from  ! Surprised Pikachu So who is going to ask Susan Collins if Trump learned his lesson? Can\u2019t believe Maine voted her back in ... She'll furrow her brows very convincingly The bombshell investigation became public during a fight over attorney-client privilege that secretly has been underway in federal court in Washington, D.C. since at least Aug. 25 this year, when prosecutors sought permission a judge\u2019s permission to override attorney-client privileged communications because of the crime-fraud exception. Oof. There\u2019s a few lawyers out there sweating bullets right now. News came out today that Rudy is looking for an advanced pardon... I wonder if that could be related to this particular meatball That's a spicy meatball. I think it it going to be something like a conversation between the White House, attorney general and Rudy.  Any conversation about a private topic would lose privilege. The history books about these last four years are going to be  . Don\u2019t forget that they\u2019ll need a Parental Advisory label and the kids will have to get forms signed by their parents to learn the Trump years. This is your evangelical hero? It's going to take all my might not to snap my phone in half over the next 4 years every time Republicans pretend to care about ethics, norms and decorum. They want to continue skating through life like they didn't just spend 4 years trying to help topple the country.  John (thanks correctors) Cornyn stood up, with a straight face, and said one of Biden's cabinet picks shouldn't be seated because she has some uncivil tweets in her history. I can't believe he didn't give himself whiplash. So they've already started. Just wait, all the old favorites will come back... fiscal hawks, anti-war, you name it, they will adopt *any* position as long as it opposes a democrat. Trump is taking the Republican party down from the inside! ABC News confirms:   At that time, the informal conversations focused specifically on whether the president could pardon himself. All these people asking for pardons, I wonder   so many people would feel they need one? Hmm... Pardon investigation is Fake News! So it's confirmed If it gets back to him within a couple of hours and he immediately tweets \u201cfake news\u201d, it\u2019s pretty much an open and shut case. Sprinkle some adderall on him and let\u2019s get out of here. Cool, so he's definitely involved in this scheme then Just a little reminder about this pardon that Trump granted in February We\u2019ve had first impeachment, what about 2nd impeachment I don\u2019t think he knows about second impeachment, Pip. Elevensies? Republicans now say have all these \"affidavits\" that people sworn under oath said they   voter fraud without any physical proof, they call that enough evidence to overturn the election. But when there were people sworn under oath that said Russia interfered with the election and Trump willingly let them help, and that he tried to interfere with investigations into them helping, that wasn't evidence at all to them, they had to have some   evidence. Republicans aren't a party, they are a cult. And the big difference is the people in the Russian investigation   in congress, while the people signing these affidavits for the trump campaign are ghosts.  And they won't show anyone the affidavits because they are \"saving the big guns for the supreme court\". And I don't want anyone to assume it would actually matter if some joe schmo testified in court. It wouldn't They demanded physical evidence in the impeachment trial over Trump extorting Ukraine to try to get them to make up dirt on Biden. Republicans loudly demanded evidence, then blocked the introduction of any evidence at all into the trial. Hey, remember when Republicans shared memes of Obama taking a torch to the constitution and told us how corrupt he was, and then none of his administration officials actually went to jail and tons of this current president\u2019s officials went to jail and now he\u2019s running a pardon racket for them Yeah, good shit Lol they   do this shit over at  . His supporters are so incredibly divorced from reality. They really do believe Trump is some reluctant hero who took it on himself to save America and the Dems are all crooks. Obama Remember   or the   or the  ? Obama mocked our democracy! If I\u2019m reading this right, this tells us the person trying to buy a pardon is already in the federal prison system. Also, someone that surrendered to BOP, not someone that was taken by police or raided. Correct? Couldn\u2019t be Stone then. Name is short too, approx 5 characters. Gen Flynn Michael Cohen Elliott Broidy It appears that the convict who wanted a Trump pardon/reprieve of sentence has a last name that ends in \"s\"  meets all the criteria. Trump He's paying himself to pardon himself. Remember when this kind of thing made Rod Blagojevich resign in disgrace?  Simpler times. Edit: I remembered it wrong.  He was impeached and removed from office by unanimous bipartisan vote.  Guess the difference was the Illinois state senate had integrity. Remember when Trump pardoned that criminal? If Trump isn't prosecuted for his crimes there is no justice in America. I think we all know the answer to this already. Out of all the news coming out in the last day, I\u2019m particularly irritated by trump getting 150+ million dollars in political donations, with no restrictions for personal use, through his \u2018leadership PAC.\u2019 It\u2019s like the cult of trump has now started its own version of a megachurch. Edit: You all are geniuses. Magachurch. My mother could help her grandkids through college someday. But no, she donates to a complete fraud of a fundraiser I wonder how   will spin this. By now they must have the goal posts on wheels. I think most of the active posters are still convinced Trump will be president on January 21st. And 22nd. And forever and ever amen. I'm tempted to look, but I also don't want to ruin my day. Barr has been radio silent since election day and then came out and dropped some nukes today. Dude is trying to save his own ass. Definitely not IMO. My money\u2019s on Barr wrapping it up quickly and \u201cconfirming\u201d nothing happened in another \u201creport\u201d prior to Biden\u2019s DOJ doing a real investigation. That way they can justify obstructing or not participating in the legitimate investigation. Feels like setting up a continued alternative narrative to me. Fox guarding henhouse. I trust that fascist fuck as far as I can throw him. Maybe this administration has made me cynical. Ghislaine Maxwell has the dirt and money to get a pardon. That's what this is about. imagine all the stuff we don't even know about yet that this administration has done, it's gonna take years of unpacking to sift through it all And now we know why Barr said what he said today. The wind has shifted. How many times is Barr getting fired tonight? Im taking over/unders. No. This is going to be about fucking Joe Exotic. Mark my words. There\u2019s very little room for good news in 2020 My hot take - Barr came out with his statement about the election because the justice department is pursuing shit so serious that he's trying to start distancing himself from the inevitable legal implications for Trump I'm curious as to why that is, because Barr basically believes the President has the authority to do literally anything he wants. If it was up to Barr the president would be an Absolute Monarch. Trump: \"Who do I have to pardon to get a   around here?\" I was wondering why Trump\u2019s camp and QAnon wwre pushing about \u201cHunter\u2019s laptop\u201d.  They just project and accuse others of what they\u2019re guilty of...no real imagination. Turns out one of   laptops was confiscated as evidence back in August. \u201cYou didn\u2019t care about hunters laptop, so why do you care about this one. See we\u2019re being persecuted!\u201d /s Conservative thread is collectively stroking out with this story and Barr poking holes in their fraud conspiracy on the same day. My grandparents like Trump because, in their words, \"He's so rich, nobody can buy him off.\" I was like how do you think he got so rich!? he didn't get so rich.  he's not rich.  he lost all of his dad's money, then he agreed to an illegal money laundering scheme with a bunch of russians where he gets to live off of loans from deutsche bank, and sell property to the russians so they can wash their money.  He's not rich, and as soon as he is no longer POTUS, he's probably going to jail for money laundering, and deutsche bank is going to seize all his properties in order to get their loans repaid since now he can't continue the money laundering. * Chopper Sounds * 2016: Lock her up! 2020: Lock him up! 2021: Pardon my family! I heard on NPR today, that presidential pardons should be taken away.   A possible scenario:  \"The president could order the assisination of a political enemy, then pardon all involved, including himself.  This is what we wanted to get away from the King of England for and was not the intention of the founders.\" I'm over it. Pardons have brought much more controversy and harm than they have brought good. Let's get rid of it As we have seen it play out, a presidential candidate can have   people do questionable or outright illegal things in order to improve his chances at winning the power to absolve them of their crimes if they're ever found out. Just remove the power for the President to pardon himself or anybody in office. Wow, Trump started hating on the GOP and tried to torpedo their Georgia Senate campaigns. GOP activated their sleeper agent Bill Barr to put Trump back into his corner. This is Machiavellian. I like what you\u2019re cooking I want to say this is Qanon level, but... ah... hmmm Biden\u2019s DOJ, better go after every last one of these traitors. Trump is ranting about it already. Therefore it's true and happened. \"The Democrat Russia investigation was a politically motivated hoax, but now that the president is threatening our senate majority, we're going to impeach, pardon, and pretend we never liked him in the first place.\" Mitch McConnell, probably Lmfao, from Dijon Mustard to this. Am I the only one who is still reeling from the fact that we elected this comically simple and depraved imbecile to the highest office in the United States? What an absolute disgrace for this country That\u2019s not even the worst part. The worst part is after four years of proving to everyone he\u2019s the imbecile you say he is, 70+ million people still voted for him. Wow, I can't believe this. It just seems so out of character for Trump. You'd think a guy who has been forcing government employees to stay at his property to enrich him and has been impeached for trying to get a foreign government to announce that they were investigating his opponent would know better. Trump exchanging his Presidential Power for money??? It just doesn't add up. I am shocked. At a White House Christmas party tonight, President Trump told guests, \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing four years. We are trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d The COVID Super Spreader Tour: Infected by the Holidaze started tonight I will never forgive the SDNY if they somehow fuck up the case against Trump that's been brewing for a few years now. If I have to still be hearing stories about him in four years that don't deal with him being deceased or in prison, we've fucked up as a country. I didn't put this in my original post, because the quote itself is far too badass to apply to DJT. But the principle does apply: You aim at the king, you best no miss This is one of the biggest scandals in presidential history. Period. How many times has that been said over the past 4 years? Wow it\u2019s almost like all the people with a brain already knew that trump was corrupt, meanwhile you have every idiot in   still thinking trump is going to win this election? It\u2019s insane how dumb people are Gee, it'd be really stupid if the power to pardon could itself be used to avoid consequences for abusing that power. That'd be realllly dumb. Yeah, I sadly expect absolutely no one to see any consequences for this. I wish pardons needed Congressional or Judicial approval. One person should never be allowed to overrule all 3 branches of government. Just allowing for that is asking for corrupt abuse. Were there not red flags when Michael Flynn was pardoned? We need you, Georgia. There was news of Rudy Giuliani  . This meltdown is going to be explosive. (WaPo paywall bypassed) The Justice Department in August investigated a potential \u201cbribery-for-pardon\u201d scheme in which a large political contribution would be offered in exchange for a presidential pardon by the Trump White House, according to court records unsealed Tuesday. The documents show that U.S. prosecutors were scrutinizing whether two individuals approached senior Trump White House officials as unregistered lobbyists, and a related scheme in which cash would be funneled through intermediaries for a pardon or reprieve of a sentence for a defendant a Spencer S. Hsu is an investigative reporter, two-time Pulitzer finalist and national Emmy Award nominee. Hsu has covered homeland security, immigration, Virginia politics and Congress. Food budget is going to be 90% popcorn after today. Oh can you imagine if the Georgia senate flips blue? Could we see the first time that a former US President is indicted on criminal charges? In Stacey we trust! Cohen may be right about Trump taking a Christmas vacation to Mar-a-Lago then disappear and never come back. He\u2019ll pardon himself and his cronies by then. What\u2019s sad is that he\u2019ll walk away with millions of dollars from some of his 70mil supporters that gave him money to fight the election \u201cfraud\u201d Scammer gotta scam. Big oof, everything the republicans have accused the democrats of has all been projection this entire time. Donald Trump only has a talent for scamming people, it\u2019s fitting that he\u2019s still trying to do it at the highest level #Trump4prison2021 This is such a massive fuck you to \u201claw and order\u201d and anyone not named Trump I'm fucking dying to know who it is. The campaign is almost certainly Trump's. I wonder if any of the scum kids are involved? Lol bet the leaks start coming this week. How is it possible-- How is it possible for Barr and Trump to throw each other under the bus when neither one of them will even fit? Considering how absolute the pardon power is, and what a grifter Trump is, I'm surprised he doesn't have a website with a menu/price list of pardons crimes. If there\u2019s ANY justice in this world, trump and all his loyalists should literally be driven to prison on Jan. 20th. Let's not mince words: this is Trump selling pardons. Good CNN segment on this They're dumping Trump's ass like a night out at golden corral. Rats abandoning ship. Trump's turn in the Barrel now. Can the president pardon someone for bribing him for a pardon? And just how much extra does that cost? Asking for   I mean, a friend. The shit winds are changin\u2019 Rand. Republican leadership must be concerned about the Georgia run-offs. This feels like they're throwing Trump under the bus to distance him from the party. \"The Senate has spoken. Beware the Ides of March.\" Plot Twist: The bus Barr and Trump are trying to throw each other under is parked on top of the swamp. There was always plenty of room underneath for both. As seen on Twitter... \"big fucking deal....all presidents have done what Trump's done\" \"You mean use his office to get rich, appointed his family, pardons for sale, yada yada\" \"Fucking Biden better not try that shit..we are watching\" \"Pay for pardon\" was   plot turn at this point in the series. Writers were feeling lazy. \"I'm never going to financially recover from this\"-Donald J. Exotic Barr: The power of a president is near absolute and oversight cannot be enforced because Jesus. Also Barr: Unless he is acting against the Party on a loser's way out. Barr announcing an investigation into Trump's illegal activity feels like a police union investigating its own misdeeds. \"We've found ourselves absolutely innocent. Good job, guys. No need to investigate further. Nothing to see here\". Who could possibly have seen this coming from such an ethical, moral, law-abiding administration? /s At this rate Trump will get on a submarine to Moscow within a fortnight If Trump's corruption could take a physical form, it would be a Russian nesting doll. It's almost popcorn time! melt some butter in a small saucepan, just 2 tbsp will do add a pinch of dried rosemary that's been bruised with the side of a knife keep the butter on low and pop your corn dump the popcorn  into your favorite bowl and pour that hot butter over it and toss add a 1/4 cup shredded fresh parmesan cheese and toss again enjoy with a little salt to taste! If its the fucking tiger king.... Would be the most 2020 shit ever We can't even have the lame duck period be normal in this administration. We have to have a full fledged impeachment level scandal that would torpedo most other presidents. The GOP must go the way of the Whigs. \"Getting the attention of a President so they know more about your legal situation is not bribery, it's smart politicking.\" - Hannity and Carlson tomorrow, probably So one of my lingering questions: how many pardons does he appear to have sold already? I mean, I think for a long time there's been a lot of suspicion, and even speculation about this happening, but I have a hard time believing it's just one, now that this story is out. The Justice Department had sought to keep the investigation private because the court documents describe \"invididuals and conduct\" that are not yet subject to prosecution, Reuters reported. I absolutely cannot wait for the documentaries in the years to come \u201cBreaking: Justice Department Seeks to Uphold the Law\u201d Just when you think they've hit bottom, Trump hauls out a backhoe and establishes yet a new low. I'm currently watching MSNBC and I'm sure it's taking everything the anchors have not to scream \"   \" into the camera. Mind you, I may be paraphrasing. \"All we found was this bag of money and a note from Rudy Giuliani that says 'pardon me, Donnie, I think you dropped this'. \"I mean, that could be anybody....\" I just want to post in a thread that might be in a history book in the future. If Joe Exotic is the one who inadvertently brings down Trump once and for all... 2020 bout to end the way it began. Nah man... Trump learned his lesson when he was impeached. Didn't you hear Susan Collins? So many people are going to be covering their asses now because Biden and his team has access to classified materials and can probably see the crimes being committed in detail. This is so fucking great lol. trump supports fingers in their ears going LA LA LA LA LA Is anyone surprised? A grift until the last day. No shit. You\u2019ve got a crooked asshole in office who\u2019s tried to profit off the presidency since the start. This fucking clown will try it now til the end. ", "Politics"], "Topic": "Politics"},

And fuck needing the Lincoln Project to do it. Oh they have a position alright and they're very successful at doing their jobs for  . Hundreds of conservative judges, big tax breaks for businesses, rollback of environmental regulations. If you were to poll the dem base and the gop base as to who was more satisfied with their politicians I'd wager repubs are much more satisfied with what they're getting. Your issue is that what their people want and what you want are very different. Republicans locking children and families in cages. Then separating them in such a way as they are lost forever to each other. While still holding the cage key, they ask. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we be more civil?\u201d We need to fire every Republican, who kissed Trump's ass, never spoke up about any wrong doing. Need someone else in replacement. It can be a younger middle thinking republican. Their position is self interest. Rules only apply to them if they benefit them. This is the lesson for all who can actually open their eyes to the truth. I think a lot of them actually believe they are saving America from communism. Is there a word for someone who's worse than a psychopath, who like enables other psychopaths and actively creates and beats down already weakened, at risk targets for them? Fascist.  They want fascism. Although there isn't scientific consensus, in common discussions the past 10-20+ years, sociopath is generally used as synonymous with a more clever and devious version of a psychopath. The latter can torment those closest to them and they are more likely to act publicly as what one expects a psychopath to act like while the former may be able to present themselves as normal and tries to obtain more power and / or hurt more people in a way that is less blatant than than a psychopath would. Either way, it is fcked up we have organized ourselves in such a way that it attracts people like that to positions of power (both government and at the top of companies) and often rewards their behavior, unless they hurt someone physically on a direct personal level. Like a small minority of the population with essentially a selfish and destructive mental illness are ruling over us and it's not just an issue in the US. Parasites Mitch. The word is Mitch. Police officer? Ghouls? Malignant  narcissist aka narcissistic psychopath aka Donald Trump Literally psychopath A tremendous psychopath, a very big psychopath from the standpoint of mental disorders? Republicans sounds fitting. Crimes against humanity This isn't psychopathy. This is war to them. The supreme court hearing when pretty much blatant did what they never said they would do just a couple years ago showed the American public this. Trump is just taking it to the next level. But the GOP has a base that understands \"winning\" is more important than anything. If you have to lie, be a hyopcrite, seem pyschopathic, unempathtic and downright lethal to the americain populace that is OKAY. It is OKAY because they aren't polticing and considering the issues oh no, this is a war against democrats and using deciet or making sacerfices is pefectly fine in that war. Blue state and red state covid casualties? Fine. Do the dems look bad when they raise taxes and do their own relief spending? Yes, excellent! Make it seem like the Dems are also forcing people to put on masks and shutting down businesses. Not the logical thing to do but  . You make a enemy out of nothing. Put a couple of filters on some plants and regulations because scientists say global warming is effecting the planet. No, the   only * believe* global warming is real. The GOP thrives when they have an enemy. Terrorists were easy. Then dems came into power and actually just assassinated Osama Bin Laden and the GOP was without an enemy. Trump makes immigrants the enemy and everything else and does a great job at it. Are immigrants the enemy? No. No they aren't. Are democrats the enemy? No. No they aren't...but making them appear that way and treat them as such is the GOP playbook. Xingoism, fear, nationalism, racism, Xenophobia, conspiracy theories and now \"winning because the enemy cheated\" doublespeak, they do not care. So in way they are psychopathic, but equally they have the strong belief the sacrifices in war are worth it. Anything to win. For four years Republicans in Congress pretended not to know what outrageous and dangerous things trump was tweeting but it turned out that they were all laser focused on Neera Tanden's twitter feed. For ten years they have ruled on rank hypocrisy and outright obstruction of governance. Don't let them forget that. You don't get to tell Merrick Garland to fuck off 3/4 of a year before an election, install Amy COVID Barrett less than a month before one, and then pretend you have a solitary moral principle in your being. You have proven beyond any doubt that your character is one of malice, partisanship, and hypocrisy. I'm sure that they were also hyper aware of anything AOC said...or Kamala Harris...or Ilhan Omar...or Ayanna Pressley...or Susan Rice...or Rashida Tlaib...or Maxine Waters... really, the list is endless. Republicans feel she is a safe target because she is a woman and she had the audacity to criticize Trump and the republicans.  Imagine that! \u201cWhat\u2019s a twitter? I don\u2019t know what he said on that\u201d This is why you always, always vote against Republicans.   Never miss the opportunity. There was a time when I gave consideration to both candidates and carefully weighed the pros and cons of their respective positions. That's over. The GOP is clearly fine with an attempt to plunge our nation into naked fascism. They are simply too dangerous to ever be allowed within spitting distance of the levers of power. Until that party dissolves and is replaced by an actually sane party, I'll just be checking Democrat on my ballots from now on. I hate that I'm reduced to one effective choice (and fuck off, Greens and Libertarians; I've already looked into you and don't like either one of you). Dead right. Even if you identify as conservative you still shouldnt. Why? Because what they say and what they do are never the same thing. Democrats may not do everything they say either, but usually its for practical reasons. Either they are obstructed from doing so, or situations change. However Republicans promise a lot, but have no intention of actually giving it to you.. See abortion bans. Vote against *low education easily manipulated misinformed self victimized dolts. They are all complicit in his criminality.  They had a chance to convict him in the Senate trial but they wouldn't even call a single witness to the stand.  Sham trial, sham party, sham president. It is hilarious, they had a chance to address real fraud during the impeachment, yet voted not to. Now the republicans are going around to various hotels holding \"hearings\" about election fraud. Any time one of these complicit pieces of trash says anything about decorum, tweets, etc. etc. The answer is \"fuck off\". I like how Sheldon Whitehouse put it: \"Don\u2019t think when you have established the rule of \u2018because we can,\u2019 that should the shoe be on the other foot, you will have any credibility to come to us and say: \u2018yeah, I know you can do that, but you shouldn\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cYour credibility to make that argument at any time in the future will die in this room and on that Senate floor if you continue.\u201d Absolutely, fuck them and their bad faith arguments.  Don't give them a chance to spout their bullshit.  Shut it down. Just use Trump's own words against them - \"I'm telling it like it is!\" or \"covfefe, baby!\" This needs to be a thing. We can't allow these rats back into the daylight as if nothing happened. They also want fiscal responsibility now. On behalf of most of reddit and many Americans, they can go fuck themselves.  I apologize for my bad language. Medicare for all is fiscally responsible. Called it. Not like it was difficult to predict that Republicans would be lying hypocrites again. That's the core of the Norquist plan. Republicans wreck the budget and the economy, then when Democrats take power, they have to fix the whole country, again. When out of power the Republicans shout about how much \"entitlements\" cost and demand the programs be cut in the name of fiscal responsibility. Never mind the fact that Republicans never pay for their programs and tax cuts, or that it's Republicans who ran up the deficit. They'll just lie, claim it was the Democrats, and their supporters will believe them because Republican voters are the only thing worse than Republican politicians. It\u2019s literally the same thing every time the power swings to Democrats. Balls in the Democrats court, they need to grow a spine and stop putting up with the bullshit. They can complain about how unfair the Republicans are, but until they start voting the same way that they speak publicly, they\u2019re as bad if not worse then the Republicans. Democrats have a track record of doing the same shit Republicans do, only spinning it in a tepid manner. I can't wait to read the headline \"Obama left the debt at $20 trillion, but now it's at $28 trillion and it's only Biden's first day! How could he possibly be so bad with money?!\" like now they ignored the 8 years of economic upslope during Obamas years and then the first week trump was sworn in they said \"look at these economic records he's setting!\" fuck them. ignore their corrupt, spineless fucking asses. god i\u2019m not even American and i\u2019m so saturated with disdain for the fucking repuvlicans Nope. They don\u2019t get to ask for that shit this late in the game. I\u2019m shitting myself hoping we get those two Democratic senate seats in GA. Republicans have no room bargaining and should be treated the same way they treated the Democrats all this time. And best part is Moscow Mitch will lose Don\u2019t get your hopes up. In its entire history Georgia has done the right thing approximately twice. Comment from a different post: I know there\u2019s a lot of optimism on here around Ossoff and Warnock, and I\u2019ll be voting for them myself, but I think they\u2019re going to lose and it\u2019s not even gonna be close. Democrats aren\u2019t gonna turn out like they did in the general and you can be sure R\u2019s will. Warnock\u2019s general was against 19 other people. If you just look at D vs R on those results it\u2019s 48% D vs 49% R. But if you look at the front runners who accounted for 79% of the total vote (Warnock, Loeffler, Collins), it\u2019s 42% D vs 58% R. I think he\u2019s gonna lose big. I think Ossoff has a chance because he was only down 1.8% and his messaging has been on point while Perdue\u2019s has been a bit flat (obviously just my opinion). Plus, let\u2019s just be real, he\u2019s white and this is still Georgia. All the numbers above are just my quick math from data on AP election results. I would love to take both seats, but realistically I think we\u2019ll be fortunate if we even get one in Ossoff. There are more than a few DINO senators like Manchin who have already promised to not let anything liberal pass, or approve any liberal cabinet members. Rats leaving a sinking ship for now... Don't underestimate how strong a base Trump has, and how much the Republicans will need to play into that for years to come if they ever want to re-gain the presidency. It's fun watching Trump meltdown but it just makes him all the more dangerous in the weeks, months and years to come. This isn't over. That's unfair to rats. Rats don't typically sink the ship they're on. If Trump announces he\u2019s going to run in 2024 then he will have most of the Republicans effectively held hostage Trump knows he has the hearts of a significant amount of the Republican base, likely the majority. And he doesn\u2019t care about the Republican party - for him it\u2019s just a means to an end. Trump can say I\u2019m going to run in 2024 as a Republican, or as an independent. Your choice. If he runs as an independent the Republican vote is split it\u2019s a guaranteed loss for Republicans, and they can\u2019t afford that. They will fall in line behind Trump again. He\u2019s still got them by the balls. Anyone taking bets on who the first GOP Senator will be to say \u201cTHE pReSiDeNt iS NoT AbOvE ThE LaW!\u201d? Lindsey. JK Mitt and Susan. Republicans after they win an election:  Republicans after they lose an election:   Bald faced hypocrisy. They wouldn't have brought this up if our shitty political media hadn't have let them get away with it in the past.  They're very likely to get away with it again now. The GOP spent 8 years obstructing literally everything Obama tried to accomplish in office. Biden should learn a lesson from that and ignore the GOP as much as possible.  If he does that, there will be 1000 think pieces and panel discussions everywhere from Fox News to the NYT decrying the Democrats' \"inability to compromise.\" Which honestly might be a good thing.... IF we retake GA then the GOP will loose their minds... that could lead to passing reform where the majority can't hold everything hostage....   #Maybe Here's the thing:  They wouldn't act like this if their voters objected. Right... The voters are the ultimate problem here And that's exactly what their endless propaganda on Fox News and every fanatical right wing outlet is for - control, manipulation; to ensure they do keep supporting a party that has no interest in advancing their own lives, while the benefactors of fascism and corruption hoard their piles wealth offshore and joke about the ignorance and accomplishments of the brainwashing that's occurred to 70 million people. It's just hilarious, isn't it? / s Their voters act against their own self interest, and by extension  , because the lies their leaders and pundits tell them are the most profitable arrangements for the people pulling the strings - shareholders and donors. They don't even need to be convincing lies because they forced logic and reason out the door 40 years ago and their rabid hatred and intolerance make their decisions for them. The GOP is a white nationalist organization that festers like roaches to reveal themselves every few decades. It's why we need to put the hammer down on them and end the tolerance of their racism and bigotry that have taken over the SC and Senate. Obama campaigned on \"Hope\" and \"Change\"and failed us. This allowed these traitors to destroy this country through retrogression and a complete take overs of the courts that led to Trump. It's now time to fix that and   the tolerance of these fascists. The GOP is a white nationalist organization This. 1000 fucking times this. Learn about  .   is a great primer, also available in the   podcast format. I'll edit if I misquoted him and I can find the place in BtB where Robert Evans says it, but I found this statement salient: There is a direct throughline from the   to the present-day GOP. Destroy the GOP and conservatism or the country will fail. The Republican position is \u201cI win and you lose.\u201d This is not a change of position. The Democrat position is \u201cwe can all win, together,\u201d which is dangerously antithetical to the Republican platform. Republicans would rather \u201cwe all lose\u201d than Democrats win, because then at least the basis of their platform would be justified. This is the best tl;dr I could make,   reduced by 88%. (I'm a bot) In another parallel to Trump, congressional Republicans were deferential not only because they considered McCarthy an ally, but also because they recognized him as a potential threat. It was years before his reign of terror was ended and one of the few Republicans who stood up against him, Sen. Ralph Flanders of Vermont, told the truth about what had happened: \"The responsibility for this thing lies squarely on the heads of the Republicans who have been obsessed with the value of McCarthy to the party. We are reaping what they have sown.\" We are seeing a return to the smarmy, sanctimonious, \"Adults in the room\" pretense of Republicans who will wring their hands over Democrats' alleged incivility and partisanship - toward Donald Trump, the crudest, most insulting brute in American politics since Joseph McCarthy.  |   |   |    :          Republicans prey on the weak minded. This is how they work and have for most of my life. Which is why I distrust most republicans and Christians. They\u2019ve never earned it, but have shown why they don\u2019t deserve it hundreds of times over I'm convinced that republican households produce lots of childhood trauma that never gets resolved unless the child moves away. So many of them adopt toxic behaviors that they display like a badge of honor. The regressives never act in good faith. It's time to just laugh in their face when they try their hypocritical pearl clutching. I am bothered by the Republican narrative that Democrats didn\u2019t accept the election results 4 years ago. Questioning the wisdom of the electoral system which ignores the overall popular vote is not the same as trying to overturn the results of a legal election, which was lost both in the popular vote and electoral college, by any means necessary. Oh we were just pretending so we could raise money and if it succeeded we would have been so shocked and surprised like Cheeto winning in 2016 but now that it's not working and fundraising is winding down we want a seat at the table again!!! Traitors.  America really should prosecute people like this. Research suggests that 1 percent of the population meets the criteria for psychopathy, so yes, I'm pretty sure a majority of elected Republicans could easily be actual psychopaths. \"You've all seen this movie before\", said Turtle Man, \"Now excuse us while we fuck you in the ass.\" Fuck em all. Civility will return when they are gone, their ideology destroyed and publicly shat on and their extremist leaders and members in jail where they belong. The Republican party has a bipolar personality. They could burn the whole government to the ground and build a new efficient government small enough to fit in a lobbyist's pocket   they might suggest  You'll have to wait until they get out of bed today to find out which. It's no surprise. That's the kind of people they are. When they have power they're violent, cruel, and merciless. They don't want to compromise they want to win. Without power they're terrified of being oppressed, because oppressing others is what they'd do with power, so they preach peace and civility. Think of it this way. They'll beat up weaker people just to make sure that weaker person knows their place, but if a stronger person comes along and hits them for any reason they start crying and screaming about how violence is wrong, even if their victim is still laying on the ground bleeding. They love hurting others, hate being hurt. Just a bunch of cowards. It does not matter what Republicans think they are. We know. The GOP is a bunch of treacherous, lying, hypocritical traitors. Republicans should be treated without political mercy, fuck em! Too many republicans are simply schoolyard bullies; they throw their weight around and kick kids when they're down, but as soon as the teacher shows up or the kids decide to group together, they suddenly are all about fairness and equality. Yes. Yes, they are. Are we still pretending they have a sense of shame? They are lying,narcissistic,misogynistic,psychopaths. Fine, they can get the ball rolling by passing some damn bills that have been waiting in limbo for years. There can be no civility when they're letting people die to score political points. Are they actually psychopaths? Yes, yes they are. I think we all predicted this. Grifting Old Pricks They've always been at war with Eastasia. All GOP Members are Traitors to the US. It's open and close why aren't we just saying it? No one should be surprised.  This is the game they've been playing for three decades. Suddenly they will care about the deficit, national security, NATO, quality cabinet appointments. The GOP is full of shit. Bunch of hypocrites It baffles me how many can see a psychopath in action over the long term and repeatedly ask questions like \u201cCan this person really be a psychopath?\u201d Yes.  Yes they fucking can. Sometimes I think I\u2019m magic. I recognize these people long before most other people do. It\u2019s really baffling. The question I\u2019m constantly asking is \u201cHOW DO YOU NOT SEE THIS?\u201d Everyone needs to realize that absolutely no one in politics gives a shit about being a hypocrite. The Republican party is the political equivalent of that shithead kid who always called time out right before you tagged him. The little asshole who insisted he got to be first player at your house because he was the guest, but got to be first player at his house because it was his house. The bully who cried bloody murder when you swung back. They deserve no special consideration or handling. Republicans are bad people and can fuck off forever. The only good Republicans stopped calling themselves that years to months ago because they saw what was going on (proud of you, Dad). I'm serious. I don't want to work with anyone who still supports Trump at this point. I don't want to   with anyone who does. I've honestly considered asking my clients if they support Trump as a screening question. well, I'm never gonna forget this and neither should anyone else I believe that what they have been saying for the last four years has been \"Fuck your feelings\"? Yes. And nazis. And traitors. All republicans are the same. Anyone who can see people protest and rally with nazi and confederate flags and say, \u201cYeah I\u2019m glad I\u2019m with this party.\u201d Are just ignorant, arrogant, filth. I will never vote for another Republican they did this to themselves They can get fucking bent for all I care. Never voting Republican again after this bullshit. And while I'm at it, some Dems can get bent too. Child caging nazis fuck off I am happy to talk civily to any Republican civilian, but likewise, any GOP politician can eat my asshole. Fuck the fascist GOP. This is their normal playbook. They do all the terrible shit and then gaslight the Democrats when they come back into power. They raised the deficit, but they will spend the next four years blaming dems for it. They abused the system, and will spend the next four years ignoring what they did and claiming that the system is broken and the dems are abusing it. The Republican's know exactly what they are doing. They fight dirty, the Dems try to stay above it and be civil, and they get taken advantage of. Every. Single. Cycle. I am so greatful for the young Dem's that are saying FUCK THAT. And fighting back. Not by going down to the Republican's level, but taking the high road and shining a painful spotlight on the reprobates. Calling them out, and then loudly pursuing change. There can't be enough Bernie Sanders and AOC's in the Dem's. We need more, and we need them now. Come back baby, it will be different this time. The best thing to happen to this country would be for the GOP to fracture into the pompous traditionalists and the bat-shit crazy MAGA conspiracy theorists, effectively neutralizing them both on a national scale. This is what happens to your brain after 4 years of defending an actual psychopath. You lose all sense of up and down. They can't keep their stories straight. I\u2019m not a fan of either party but republicans disgust me at this point. They chose party over country. They shouldn\u2019t be forgiven. If you are willing to disregard the path you took to appease a wannabe dictator, you don\u2019t deserve to represent the American people. How can they be trusted? Are politicians psycopaths?!? Gasp, it almost as we forgot that most of these people were   basically acting above the law way before Trump was on the scene. The only thing you can count on a Republican to be is a hypocrite.  They want you to follow their rules and one of their rules is they get to ignore laws and norms.  Why?  Because fuck you,  that's why. They always sing a different song when they\u2019re out of power. They\u2019re already complaining about the deficit. They are the ones that ran it up. It\u2019s the usual formula. Outrageous abuse of power when in office, then wailing and clutching your pearls about deficits and moral turpitude when Democrats are. The template is so plainly obvious, but orc muggles never notice or punish them for it. Their voters never punished them. The victory was never about being truthful or good. The victory was in convincing their voters that Democrats are bad - like, literally evil. And it works. Why wouldn\u2019t they keep doing it? If the GOP survives the next 4 years then America deserves its fate. It\u2019s unbelievable we can live in the age of information and still act/believe like braindead cavemen. They want civility?  \"Civility\" includes abiding by rule of law, prosecuting those guilty of defrauding US citizens, enabling a global fascist movement, etc., calling it [anything else]. Yeah, we'll be CIVIL.  We will prosecute and convict those guilty of collecting and spending public funds, while using disinformation to gain political control.  FRAUD, for starters, and to reclaim any possible ill-gotten gains, RICO.  I think we can show conspiracy (talking-points memos for starters) and profiteering. Screw them, screw them one and all. They\u2019re not psychopaths, they know exactly what they\u2019re doing and Republicans will mostly buy this shit. The only solution is to never give them a chance to \u201cprove themselves\u201d again. They\u2019ve had plenty of chances over the past 40 years, yet our country has backslid into a decrepit shell of the world hegemon we used to be. Conservatism is a disease that rots empire. GOP no longer represents the public.  It now represents the wealthy elite.  GOP's goals are simple: Direct the money to the top, control the masses through confusion and subversion. Of course they are. Now that a Democrat is coming in they have a target they can focus on, rather than ignoring the actions of the President. Hypocrites. But it\u2019s to be expected, and not at all surprising. I used to say Republicans lack cognitive dissonance, but honestly this goes way beyond even that. I may not always like Democrats but at least they\u2019re fairly consistent in the application of rhetoric Democrats are also more likely to recognize and turn on a bad leader. One reason why Trump originally won is many democrats didn't want to vote for another Clinton. Republicans would vote for Starlin as long as it's on the GOP ticket. Anything to not vote for commie democrats. Psychopaths? Yes. They care about money and power more than human suffering. That's Grade A standard psychopathic behavior. Edit: Actually that's not fair. Many republicans   human suffering more than money and power. Pretty sure Biden is the one asking for \u201cUnity\u201d. #cnntapes Civility... That would have been nice one time in the past 4 years. It's going to be a slog, but it's light years ahead of where we were. Exactly and trump is the great divider-in-chief. Nobody Unless/until the republican voting base starts caring about their leaders acting in good faith, demonstrating ethical behavior, being civil, and doing things the legal way, this is how the political right is going to behave in America. It is disheartening to see so many millions of people in the United States vote for candidates in a party that flat refuses to respect the office of the president or our allies. Far too many people here seem cool with the fascistic tendencies displayed by today's republican party. Lie, cheat, steal, protect a scumbag, and still expect civility? They should be offered a heaping helping of \u201cget fucked.\u201d I think sociopath is more apt. Call the wahmbulence. Hopefully people have seen the ol' bad faith two-step enough times to recognize it and push back this time... We'll see. Then maybe damn Mitch McConnell could try working with Democrats and moderate Republicans to get something done. What a joke. Bunch of posers When will US change from two party system to multiparty system? gaslighting 101. The only conservative christian value is power Trump Lawyers: \u300aInsert Name\u300bshould be taken out and shot. Next day:  It was just a joke, come on!!! TRUMPCULT. Republicans can shove their 'ethics and civility' up their asses. Want nothing to do with these people. Anyone surprised by this behavior from the GOP shouldn\u2019t be. Yes, and it's our duty to point out their hypocrisy and to ignore their complaints. We must not allow Republicans to shape the narrative at this point. They've abdicated their responsibilities to this country for too long. They do this every time. It shouldn't really shock anyone. Is water wet? They are worse than psycopaths, they are sociopaths. Psycopaths are obvious, sociopaths are insidious. It is pretty impressive how they are able to do horrible things and face no repercussions, I mean when is the last time you heard the msm talking about the way they got their latest supreme court justice? As long as there is ignorance and extremely short memories Republican politicians will have a place. A southern-military-conservative former friend told me, in almost these exact words, how much it hurts her when I treat her the way she treats me. I\u2019ve been waiting for this shit. For too long we have let our plutocratic overlords tell these gaslight fairy tales about the responsible republicans and the profligate democrats.  We must stop accepting the fairy tail. We must understand that these people are all acting in their own self interest. Interest which is largely built on a racist, sexist, classist platform. I have for so long tried to see both sides as equally legitimate but I just can't anymore. Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of issues with certain democrats as well, but holy hell the whole republican party is just fucking trash. The entire economic platform is inherently selfish, and their \"wholesome American family religious values\" based social platform is nothing but socially harmful and antiquated bullshit trying to get the world to conform to their ass-backwards interpretation of a 2000 year old book.  And it's all just a facade for unregulated private industry so the wealthiest and most powerful people/corporations can continue doing whatever the fuck they want. There is no longer any redeeming quality in the political right in this country. There are 2 groups of republican voters People who are wealthy enough to actually benefit from republican economic policies who selfishly vote in their own self interest at the detriment to society as a whole (worsening economic inequality, stripping of environmental protection, the list goes on) People who are dumb enough to be convinced to actively vote against their own self-interest (this is the   majority) It's become increasingly clear: republicans yell and make a scene when you try to do good things for the country or for the people.  When you try to do bad things for the country, they go silent. So let that be your barometer going forward. This is what happens when there are no actual consequences for breaking the rules or the laws. When you can lie, cheat, steal, and commit crimes publicly without penalty or punishment, many people will opt to do these things. And usually, but in fairness not always, they are Republicans.  Perfectly exemplifies why so many of these people are so pro religion because in all honesty without the moral and righteous direction given them by the Lords commandments, they would literally not even know right from wrong. I don't think religion generally makes much difference in people's \"moral compass\". Whether atheist, agnostic, or devout believer, a person has tremendous capacity to rationalize any decision. And peer-group pressure and tribalism can make a lot of people gradually -- or swiftly -- crash through their own boundaries. Why else would so many \"good people\", in myriad cultures, get behind authoritarian demagogues and the harms and horrors they perpetrate? Why do so many \"good people\" get drawn in to genocides? I think Philip Zimbardo's \"The Psychology of Evil\" is one of the best TEDtalks ever. The GOP won this election. They packed the courts, pushed thru an unprecedented 3 justices in 4 years, made gains in the house, and held the Senate. They did all of this without the consent of the majority and on the losing end of a landslide popular vote. The only thing that they conceded was Trumps dumb ass which they wanted to get rid of anyways. If the democrats fail to get prosecutions that result in actual prison terms then they so shouldn't even bother showing up Jan 20th. Why do we even let them speak? When the Republicans were in charge everything a Democrat said was disregarded. Ignore their voices. Turn off their microphones. Win Georgia. Shut them out of every bill. Their intentions are clear, make Democrats look bad at any cost, pay back their corporate Masters. I can't wait for senate Democrats to be like \"y'know, maybe this time they mean it, we should really try to work together!\" Did anyone *not* see this coming? It was pretty obvious from the beginning that they were gonna ride him as far as they could, use him and his rabid idiot fanbase to get whatever legislation they wanted, then when reality caught  up pretend they didn't know about any of his many, many crimes and act like they never supported him and are shocked and appalled. They started this war. We should finish it. We need to criminalize the GOP. Make the proud boys into a terrorist organization, and financial support for it, or membership of it should come with a 5 year+ jail sentence. Take ICE apart, and send every single officer who is guilty to jail for decades. Take the CIA and NSA operatives who supported mass surveillance on american citizens to JAIL. Every single officer who broke their oath to the constitution because they were \"following orders\" needs to pay the price. The words of the chain of command are fickle. The constitutional rights of americans and the bill of rights supercedes them, and for breaking the fourth ammendment, the  NSA needs to be imprisoned. They need to be made an example of for future cia and nsa officers. And while we are at it, the business licenses of right wing organizations needs to be revoked on the grounds of promoting information that caused deaths of people who believed them. Specifically covid denial. They need to be brought to trial, and public executions need to be levied against the ceos who let this slide. The anchors who parroted the lines need to be publicly shamed, and banned from newsmedia for life. And the churches who supported all of this shit while not paying taxes need to be relabeled into tax organizations. They need to pay back taxes for 7 years, and if the churches go broke, the pastors who spouted garbage to their congregants to support political candidates from the pulpit need to be held financially liable for the back taxes. If they can't pay, they go to jail for tax evasion. 10 years. And when the gop rushes to get their rifles, we let them assemble on the field of battle. Then we roll out the US military to round them up, disarm them, and give them all 3 year sentences doing community service. Democrats simply need to muster up the guts to fight back. Coordinate. Plan. For example, every single fucking nominee needs to start their prepared statement with the same thing, something along the lines of: Before I begin, I want to publicly state that neither I or anyone in my immediate family arranged to meet with Russian agents in order to acquire stolen property from a political rival. Seriously...throw it in their fucking faces at every opportunity. The best way to not allow them to get away with it is to be persistent in reminding them of their actions and pointing their hypocrisy every time they try to hide it. While I recognize the need for the left to reach out to the less visible, and far less toxic centrists and sane conservatives, compromising with fascists is a mistake. Remember Chamberlain before World War II? \u2018Peace in our time?\u2019  Yeah. That worked out great. You don\u2019t compromise with cancer. You eradicate it from the host body if you want the host body to live. Fuck these traitors.  Anyone with an (R) in front of their name is a Russian as far as I'm concerned Yes they are What clued you in? last time I checked, they are closer to sociopath than psychopath, anyway,  neither of which is a trait you want   someone to have for a job that important The modern Republican Party has much in common with those YouTube \u201cpranksters\u201d who run up behind random strangers and hit them on the head, only to run away screaming, \u201cIT\u2019S JUST A PRANK BRO!\u201d They are currently at the running and screaming stage. I hope one of them goes full Trump & says,Donald Trump,don't know the man never heard of him \u201dYour jaw has to drop at the utter absurdity of any Republican saying such a thing,\u201d At one time maybe, but not anymore. Disingenuousness and duplicity is what I expect from Republican \u201cleaders\u201d. I just assume if they\u2019re talking, they\u2019re not being forthright. Republicans are psychopaths?? My god! I also discovered today that my trash can lid opens when I step on the pedal at the bottom. Who knew?? The GOP is behaving exactly as predicted. Never ever let them forget they were all in on the Trump Train from 2016-2020 and caused this mess. To maintain civility, we need to jail these psycho fascists. Welcome to 2020 where asking if our elected leaders are actually psychopaths is a completely reasonable headline. Answer:  perhaps, but mostly they are fascists. Let them play pretend. When the time comes and thier seats are up for grabs, we have endless content saved on the internet to absolutely destroy them and very little editing is needed. They did this to themselves. Now that they are laid bare and to waste, Democratic infighting will become the new norm and they will attack their own. It is the nature of how our government works and the power of the flow money. This is classic GOP tactics, we should all prepare for it and prepare to say fuck you. ", "Politics"], "Topic": "Politics"},
{"In the media, women politicians are often stereotyped as consensus building and willing to work across party lines. However, a new study found that women in the US tend to be more hostile than men towards their political rivals and have stronger partisan identities.": ["What I take away from this is that media likes to portray US politics as much more functional and reasonable than it is. And this study is only relegated to US politics - which is barely functional as is. The media portrays politics as functional.  Seriously? What media likes to do is keep the \"Women are Wonderful\" myth alive, because it's profitable. I can barely listen to NPR anymore because that's all it seems to do. The weekend shows had been a tradition my whole life I think US politics is working about as it was designed. We have a system where it's only possible to do 'big things' when a majority of the country is behind you for a long enough time.   But, our country is about evenly split -- in the last election, about half of the people voted for Trump and about half of the people voted against him, and the House and Senate are about balanced.   In that environment, there can be no big changes.  Instead, we have to wait for the country to make up its collective mind about which way it wants to head. That may change in 2022, when 22 Senate seats held by Republicans will be up for grabs in the election (only 12 for Democrats). Esp. female politicians, correct? from the article: \u201cWomen are   affectively polarized than men, meaning that there is a larger difference between women\u2019s feelings towards their political party and their feelings towards the other political party,\u201d Ondercin told PsyPost. ... The findings, which have been published in the journal American Politics Research, indicate that  Because   it is. Well yea that is not surprising. Women have stronger attitudes about their own bodily autonomy? Shocking. Ya... I didn\u2019t need to read the article to figure this out. If one party is trying to tell you what you can and can\u2019t do with your body, you\u2019ll probably have strong partisan feelings. Sounds reasonable to me. So, nothing to see here? Misleading title - while it specifies \u2018women politicians\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019 in separate, accurate statements, it implies women politicians are representative of women voters, rather than a self-selected separate group I interpreted both sentences as referring to \"women politicias\" at first Women politicians and women voters aren\u2019t separate (unique) groups. Women politicians are a subset of women voters. What the headline is trying to say, which I do think it a fairly accurate headline \u2014 is that while people (generally) might think of / see women politicians as being consensus builders, those very same women (politicians) are a subset of a much larger group (all women), who tend to be more partisan than men (generally speaking). How much of this can be attributed to a \"new blood\" kind of effect? Government in the US has long been a \"good old boys\" club, and the old men usually see each other as colleagues even across party lines. But most women, especially as of late, get elected on platforms of upheaval, and more recent examples of freshman congresswomen have shown much stronger commitments to ideological goals than their tenured male counterparts who have historically shown to be more concerned with baby-step politicking. It's only natural that an ideologically driven newcomer is going to be much more hostile, or at least less cordial, to their strict ideological opponents,   in specific cases like Congresswoman Oscario Cortez and \"the Squad\", who have been held up by their opposition as the literal devil. There's more than one new congresswoman in that position, and there's some obvious circumstances on the part of their opposition that is going to drive a stronger stance. There is evidence that the aggression is not unique to modern us politics. As another poster linked regarding kings vs queens. Well that, and more liberal areas are way more likely to elect women. So you get more liberal/left leaders from more liberal areas. the title is confusing but the second statement is about all women in the US, not just women politicians. So, do we always need to provide an interpretation can't we just accept what the data says? The post title is from the linked academic press release here: New research suggests there is a gender gap in affective polarization: Women in the United States tend to be more hostile than men towards their political rivals. The findings, which have been published in the journal American Politics Research, indicate that this gender gap is related to women\u2019s stronger partisan identities and stronger attitudes about abortion. \u201cIn the media, women politicians are often stereotyped as consensus building and willing to work across party lines,\u201d said study author Heather Louise Ondercin (@HeatherOndercin), an assistant professor at Appalachian State University. The source journal article is here: You\u2019ve Lost That Loving Feeling: How Gender Shapes Affective Polarization Heather Louise Ondercin, Mary Kate Lizotte American Politics Research First Published November 18, 2020 IF:  DOI:  Abstract We examine variation in levels of affective polarization for men and women. Using the 1980 to 2016 American National Election Studies, we find that women are more affectively polarized than men. The effect of sex partially works indirectly through political identities and issue positions. Moreover, sex acts as a moderator, with political identities and issues positions have different effects on men\u2019s and women\u2019s level of affective polarization. Three factors create women\u2019s higher levels of affective polarization: women are more likely to be partisans, strength in abortion attitudes, and partisanship has a more substantial influence on women\u2019s attitudes compared to men\u2019s attitudes. Breaking the analysis apart into three time periods: (1) gender gap emergence 1980 to 1988, (2) elite polarization 1990 to 1998, and (3) hyper-partisanship 2000 to 2016 reinforces that partisan strength is central to understanding affective polarization. Additionally, during the 1990s when elite polarization is intensifying the strength of issue attitudes and ideology. It's interesting, I remember an historical article from a while back that made a case of female rulers being more prone to go to war over make rulers. I'd like to find that again, though don't have the time atm. It specifically points to abortion, which obviously effects women more. It wonder if women would be as partisan is abortion wasn't such a hot button issue. This poor sub. Gets used and abused for reddits political theater purposes Always has been What I get out of this is that we need to stop stereotyping everyone. Men are X, women are Y. It's nonsense. Everyone is an individual.   women are cooperative and willing to collaborate, some other women are highly competitive and individualistic. We have to stop with this notion that you can predict a person's behavior or beliefs by their identity. It can be interesting to look for discrepancies, but the conclusions should not be taken as proof of some underlying biological difference between men and women. They are most likely just a reflection of social prejudices and stereotypes unless proven otherwise. Wait, so women are people too? With unique and individual characteristics? I'll be damned. Do we have good evidence that women politicians are often stereotyped as consensus building and willing to work across party lines? That's not my impression at all. The only woman politician I can think of stereotyped as such is Angela Merkel, and that's because she _is_ a consensus builder willing to work across party lines. Not how Margaret Thatcher was stereotyped. Or Hillary Clinton. Or Nicola Sturgeon. Or AOC. Or Nancy Pelosi. Or Jacinda Ahern. Or Indira Gandhi etc. I suppose there is a claim that is sometimes made that if there were more women politicians we'd have less war or what have you, but it evaporates as soon as you look at how actual women politicians are treated by the media (and indeed the behaviour of women politicians). Edit: correct spelling of Gandhi. I think that the point was that people thought that female politicians where in general less hostile. Thank you. The actual title of the article is much better than OP's. Susan Collins (and Olympia Snowe before she retired) is seen as a moderate or consensus builder. So are Lisa Murkowski and Jeanne Shaheen to a lesser extent. In a gentle way, you can shake the world. Just so you know, the correct spelling is  . When does the media portray female politicians in the US as consensus building? Women are more likely to have in-group bias than men. I think that study was posted here as well. It's likely an evolutionary trait. This is hardly surprising. If many have the opinion that women will compromise and work with you in politics it will lead to more people attempting to take advantage of that. The only women politicians that will survive are therefore the one that don't compromise and fight back when someone tries to take advantage of the stereotype. I just recall how during a debate Warren claimed Sanders made some horrible, rapey sexist remarks. He denied it, said he never said anything like it - and immediately afterwards, as they were leaving the scene, she confronted him for \"making her look like a liar.\" So her making him look like a creep was okay? I don't recall the remarks being rapey. I thought Warren recounted a conversation with Bernie where she claimed he stated a woman couldn't win the presidency. Bernie denied making that statement and Warren confronted him about it. Not that it changes too much - but setting the record straight she never accused him of rapey/creeper remarks, just plain ole sexism. I thought this was obvious by... You know, paying attention? This definitely won\u2019t go over well I was going to ask: \"how does this relate to science?\" And then I learned about social science. I hate politics but I accept its an important part of daily life Social science pretends to be science, and yet I think we should come up with a better word for it that places it in a separate category of knowledge. Proper experimentation in social sciences, as in double blinded experiments with one variable and a control group, are essentially impossible without violating human rights. Doesn\u2019t make social science an invalid field, but it should not be put in the same category of mathematical predictability as physics. Nah, i dont buy it. Women acting similarly to men are typically seen as hostile. In the media, women politicians are often stereotyped as consensus building and willing to work across party lines. Since when, and on which media outlets? Most media coverage I watch seems to want to portray everyone as either shrill, spittle-emitting ideologues or smug, corrupt sleazeballs, and sometimes both at the same time. Yeah, OP invented that headline. It has nothing to do with the actual study. This actually makes sense to me. Women, in general, have to work harder for recognition. For politics, it seems like the consequence of this would be to double down on the party line to prove themselves. The problem is, the study says   about female politicians. It's about female  . The link to the politicians is made by the study's author, but nothing in the study itself singles them out. Women are slightly more affectively polarized than men, meaning that there is a larger difference between women\u2019s feelings towards their political party and their feelings towards the other political party That   are   more affectively polarized is a very different conclusion than what the headline implies. It's not about politicians, as far as I can tell, it's just the general populace. Also, only the women with the strongest opinions will find that struggle worth it. If your opinions are more moderate, you might lose your energy and drop out around the one hundredth time someone tells you to go back to the kitchen. Often enough though, that's sadly still true in perception even if it isn't so much in reality... - and then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's a well-known effect with the same roots as the effect that members of groups for which a stereotype exists that they are bad a certain task are aware of that stereotype and worry about it - which means both that they use cognitive effort on this that could be used for the tasks at hand, and that their actions and reactions are biased by this perception. It's over-correcting for perceived insufficiencies - a widespread tendency. In such situations, even non-biased surroundings don't make that go away immediately (or at all, if the cognitive habits are sufficiently fixed) - though as always, building a more welcoming environment for everyone is incredibly helpful and a very worthy goal for all of us everywhere. \u201cWomen, in general, have to work harder for recognition\u201d Imagine saying that in the age of the \u201cFemale Creator spotlight\u201d Women, in general, have to work harder for recognition Why do you say that? Do women have to work harder for recognition in politics? Is that merely narrative, or is it proven? Because i've seen some studies that show being a woman is an advantage in politics, including the one with gender-flipped trump and clinton. \"Many were shocked to find that they couldn\u2019t seem to find in Jonathan Gordon what they had admired in Hillary Clinton\u2014or that Brenda King\u2019s clever tactics seemed to shine in moments where they\u2019d remembered Donald Trump flailing or lashing out. For those Clinton voters trying to make sense of the loss, it was by turns bewildering and instructive, raising as many questions about gender performance and effects of sexism as it answered.\" I.E, if Clinton was a man, many clinton voters would no longer be able to say what they liked about her. Meanwhile, they'd view Trump as smart and clever and so on if he was a woman. Does that sound like women are disadvantaged in politics? Incidentally: \"We heard a lot of \u201cnow I understand how this happened\u201d\u2014meaning how Trump won the election. \". (I.E, the Democrats involved were suddenly cognizant of how, if you aren't a pro-woman or anti-male sexist like them, Trump was the preferable candidate and a likable character. \"The simplicity of Trump\u2019s message became easier for people to hear when it was coming from a woman\u2014that was a theme. One person said, \u201cI\u2019m just so struck by how precise Trump\u2019s technique is.\u201d\" ). This seems like the opposite of a disadvantage. It seems like anti-male bias in politics. That makes sense. plus, many \"party line\" positions uniquely affect women. Women are politically polarized because apparently, politics is what determines our basic human rights. I'm not sure if the majority of american female politicians are left-leaning, but if so, many of their \"political rivals\" would be in favor of restricting their reproductive freedoms. That sounds like a good reason to be hostile. The conclusions are based on feelings towards the opposite political party. I'd like to see if a group of polarized women is more or less likely to come to a consensus than a group of polarized men for a more humanized follow-up study. You get what you pay for. US voters are electing hostile, partisan, candidates and refusing to elect consensus building compromisers.  Gender doesn't matter to this equation because we are not taking random women and putting them in power - we are picking out the ones who spit venom and then observing that a lot of female politicians are vipers.  No surprise there. Note: the natural rebuttal to my point above is Joe Biden - who is very much a consensus builder and compromiser, and he just won a major election.  All of that is true.  I would however argue that his win was born out of a very unique set of circumstances where the Democrats had just come out of losing an election they thought it was impossible for them to lose, and were facing the prospect of 4 more years of Donald Trump who they viewed (whether correctly or incorrectly) as the worst possible human being who could be President, and their choice of Biden was designed to play it safe.  Against any one other than Trump, and in any situation other than having already lost to Trump once in shocking fashion, the Democrats would have nominated someone much more partisan and hostile. The difference between the presidential and congressional election results indicate that votes for Biden were better described as votes against Trump (with plenty of Republicans speaking out against Trump even) US voters are electing hostile, partisan, candidates and refusing to elect consensus building compromisers. It would seem based on some of the comments in this thread that US voters do this because they themselves are hostile partisans with no interest in compromise.  I think the election of Donald Trump represents a fundamental change in the political zeitgeist of America.  Republicans signaled under Obama that they were no longer interested in working across the aisle, and Democrats responded to 2016 by agreeing that they were no longer interested either.  I don't think that's going to change for either party any time soon.  In fact I assume the divide will only get wider from here, with increasingly partisan members of both parties replacing the older moderate members for years to come. Was Obama a hostile, partisan, candidate? Politicians have different incentives and context than regular people. It's also possible to feel strongly and still be a good collaborator -- even if you still push for what you want, being good at communication can forge commonality. As always, the headline isn't what the study means. Arguably totally irrelevant, and definitely drawing novel conclusions not supported by the study. For the record: Neither politicians nor media portrayals of them were studied. Only asking women (not specifically politicians) to respond to prompts about their attitude toward issues and partisan identity. Anybody who has ever thought that women are more peaceful conciliatory has never spent a lot of time around women. There's a very good reason why a classical Republican system had citizenship tied to military service. How much of this is due to cross-gender versus same-gender interactions? It's easier for men in the mostly-male Congress to reach across the aisle because to them it is business as usual - have lunch, play golf, go to the gym. For women, who don't have that extra thing in common with most colleagues, other forms of commonality - like political party - are  stronger. Off topic but I don't know if going to the gym is a good example. About half the gym goers I see are women, maybe a little less. They probably make up half the fitness influence on socail media, maybe a bit more and probably receiving much more attention (to be fair probably for the wrong reasons for what it's worth). But I don't think the gym is really a male activity these days. I wonder if you could compare this to women being more religious than men. Maybe women are just more rigid in their ideologies in general. I\u2019m would like to see Republican men compared to Democratic women, because I\u2019d bet my bottom dollar that US party identity is a bigger determining factor than sex in politicians This study is about the media lying American women have strong opinions? Who knew. I guess this is a more philosophical/political than a data driven question, but is 'being willing to work across party lines' necessarily a positive trait? I'm aware this is not what the study is asking, but it does make me wonder. In general, it is. In an ideal world, politicians would work having their own beliefs in front (representing those that voted for them) and having the nations best interest in front. But not \"working across party lines\" means to not be able to work with the other party(s) when their objectives align with your own beliefs, or just not doing it because improving the nation (under the other party's rule) would mean a \"victory\" of their side, implying a \"loss\" of your own party. As a consequence, you loss the ideal representation a politician should replicate while simultaneously the nation's best interest is damaged because parties will not collaborate. Ruling in democracy means to reach agreements, middle points between the different groups, opinions, morals. When people stop talking between each other, the next best way to get your point across is through violence. Yes. Being able to work across party lines shows an ability to look at the issues, not the party, to compromise and generally behave like a reasonable adult. but is 'being willing to work across party lines' necessarily a positive trait? not when only one side is ever expected to do it.  that just means the overton window is doomed to shift toward the side that is never expected to compromise Regardless of the quality of the science here, it would be sufficient to be of interest if it only highlights a common misapprehension. It doesn\u2019t have to say whether the trait is good or bad. When both sides act in good faith, yes. There are women in US speaking against abortion rights, saying women should not vote, saying women should stay at home and be obedient to their husbands. Adult women, born less than 50 years ago. It\u2019s not surprising that this was the find. I mean one of the reasons it took suffrage so long to happen in the US is that the movement was also tied to prohibition Seems like people who were at one point deprived of human rights and equality for decades, while having their rights currently threatened, would be have stronger political convictions. Also this entire thread is just people saying: 'oh no surprises, like gender stereotypes are always accurate. IMO its a misleading correlational study that I'd like to see actually verified instead of jumping the gun. Obvious question is why? I think itll likely be sociological, ideological or what have you rather than any inherent part of the \"female mind\" or whatever. All you need to do is look at Waters, AOC, Omar, Pelosi, Harris.  That will tell you all you need to know. Probably because women have far more to lose in politics than men. It makes sense when one party has been attacking women's rights for decades. There is no need to pull punches when people are trampling your individual freedoms. White women in particular have always been held in high esteem regarding their \"progressive\" political and social values. Kathleen M. Blee, a professor of sociology, aware of that stereotype, decided to explore its veracity. What she discovered was that white women, especially in the 1920s, were a formative block in aiding the KKK, which reached its most powerful and numerous in that same decade. \"Women of the Klan\" is a great book that attempts to determine how \"progressive\" and \"socially unifying\" white women are in society. They have more to lose. More to fight for. ", "Science"], "Topic": "Science"},

Here, we demonstrate that intravenous inoculation of SIV-infected macaques, a well-accepted non-human primate model of HIV infection, with adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing construct designed for eliminating proviral SIV DNA, leads to broad distribution of editing molecules and precise cleavage and removal of fragments of the integrated proviral DNA from the genome of infected blood cells and tissues known to be viral reservoirs including lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and brain among others. Accordingly, AAV9-CRISPR treatment results in a reduction in the percent of proviral DNA in blood and tissues. These proof-of-concept observations offer a promising step toward the elimination of HIV reservoirs in the clinic. Thank you for this information. Very hopeful for my family member with HIV. It's been controlled for some time now with extremely expensive medicine. But, a cure would be fantastic. Isn't saying human HIV as redundant as saying HIV virus or ATM machine? HIV can go to other primates and undergo small mutations. It's a weird technicality, and it kinda isn't the human virus anymore, but also it kinda is, so they just say Human HIV to assert that it's the human variant, most likely. \"you have been infected with the human human immunodeficiency virus virus\" This has really been a gold medal year in the science community. I hope this is close enough to the topic, but what kind of serious predictions have there been on what a cure for aids would do for low income countries in Africa and Asia?

{"Cannabidiol in cannabis does not impair driving, landmark study shows": ["Since there appears to be some confusion,   found that the THC in cannabis   impair driving. However the study was primarily focused on the effects of CBD in cannabis, hence the title. A landmark study on how cannabis affects driving ability has shown that cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis component now widely used for medical purposes, does not impair driving,  . reminder than THC   impair driving, as also found by the study I\u2019m not going to be able to find a right place to post this, so I\u2019ll reply in this comment since it is related to THC impairment: While you   get high/or impaired from CBD in isolation, you   get high from full spectrum CBD products. Particularly if you have a low THC tolerance. Full spectrum CBD products (most oils or pills) have small amount of THC in them. If taken excessively, you can absolutely become high/impaired. I take CBD regularly and there have been numerous times where I\u2019ve gone slightly over my normal dose and gotten high. It\u2019s a thing. It also really sucks ass if you\u2019re taking a higher dose because of bad anxiety and you end up getting high when you weren\u2019t expecting to. CBD on its own, no impairment. Full spectrum CBD, can cause it. It\u2019s not necessarily  , but you definitely can. Edit: Plenty of big time stoners and toke-wizards drying to disprove the verifiable fact that there is THC in Full-Spectrum CBD products. It\u2019s not very hard to figure out. You might want to back to weed school. Wouldn't the difference be in reference for those that take CBD without THC for various medicinal causes, but may still be \"busted\" or what have you for being \"high\"? It\u2019s also been shown numerous times that level of tolerance directly translates to whether THC affects your fine motor skills or spatial awareness. I have a high tolerance and could probably handle driving stoned (never have; never will). But, some don\u2019t have a high tolerance. There\u2019s no way you could make a law to fit all abilities, so the best way to protect the public is to make driving stoned illegal across the board. Now they just need a way to tell because it\u2019s BS to get a DWI/DUI for a joint you smoked a week ago. It does not impair me, i can ride a bike without handle bars and run across mountain trails as well as i would sober. I wonder what the threshold for being \"impaired\" in this study. Studies have shown people under the influence of thc are better drivers than drowsy drivers. They also have the lowest rate of domestic violence. Mild impairment. I bet less than having children in your backseat, or most pharmaceutical drugs for a cold/flu. Okay but so does caffeine, I'm sure getting a sugar high or nicotine withdrawal also impairs driving yet nobody seems to care since those are legal. CBD doesn't impair you, THC does. Yeah, I thought this was common knowledge by now. I'm worried people scrolling through without clicking the article will think smoking and driving is fine... It\u2019s also important that THC only impairs you for a few hours. It does not impair you the next day when you can be tested and it can be found in your system. It doesn\u2019t work the same as alcohol and the current testing in inadequate. Current testing does not test if a driver is impaired rather just if they have used in the past ~48 hours. That means having it in your system does not equal driving under the influence. Yeah but people are gonna turn this into \"see! Weed doesnt impair driving!\" Fun fact, there are two types of psychoactive THC, delta-8 THC and delta-9THC. Delta-8 is considered less psychoactive and until recently was not scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act (Source; does work at a cannabis lab) This is obviously true, but happy to see actual studies coming out confirming it. CBD can help a lot of people without the side effects of other drugs, but the stigma around it has to change first. Yea it does \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Not according to the study by the definitely-not-biased science guy who looks like he woke up on a stranger\u2019s couch this morning. Why are people so desperate to glorify weed as some super-drug that you could do any normal activities on while simultaneously enjoying the mind altering effects. Pick one or the other. You can\u2019t have it both ways. Don\u2019t smoke and drive. It\u2019s pretty simple. The people conducting this study haven\u2019t rode with me stoned (which I don\u2019t do anymore) it wasn\u2019t great. Idk had some cbd and went to grocery store and definitely noticed I was worse. Different for everyone I guess but that was a first/last for me. Also, even if THC doesn't impair you, I don't think you could concentrate very well, at least only on driving, which is what would mess me up. I live in Canada, I personally wont take CBD while driving, it will cause a false positive for THC. A lot of people can drive perfectly fine while high, but I would end up in a fourteen car pile up if I were to get behind the wheel like that. Especially now since I don\u2019t smoke anymore. The extent to which THC can impair you is understated. According to my Gran Turismo 6 times, THC doesn't either. I feel like I have to constantly remind people of this Yeah, for people who don\u2019t understand, this could be a misleading headlining Said someone who's probably never smoked weed... Many study's have shown it doesn't impair driving significantly. Unless the user uses way to much. It should be based on how well you are driving, not on weather or not you smoked. This has to be one of the most socially irresponsible headlines I have ever seen. Yeah I was going with... Some early starting edibles got me into ... non.. optimal situations... The landmark study also makes the distinction  while CBD does not impair driving, THC does: A landmark study on how cannabis affects driving ability has shown that cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis component now widely used for medical purposes, does not impair driving, while moderate amounts of the main intoxicating component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produce mild driving impairment lasting up to four hours. while moderate amounts of the main intoxicating component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produce mild driving impairment lasting up to four hours. but in many states it means you're guilty of DUI for the next 4  ! I\u2019ve read studies that thc does impair driving; however, not as significantly for most people when compared to alcohol (also depends on everyday usage vs one time). The major impairment found was that thc drivers drove slower. There is a threshold of highness though that does impair driving skill. Though I think it was best described as smoking a joint to one self then immediately driving. I think driving high should be a ticket and not a full blown DUI, I think the risk of driving under thc is significantly less than driving under the influence of alcohol and it has been backed up by studies. Though I doubt this will happen until there is a way to accurately test thc impairment while driving. They are getting ready to publish results from a similar study that took place at the University of Colorado (Boulder Campus). I was really thrilled to be a participant in it! I had an initial intake appt at which they did a lot of memory, reflex, strength, balance type tests, did a complete interview about the products I consume (both Rx and not) and how much I drink. I then had to submit to bloodwork and urinalysis. I left with a ticket to pick up my randomly assigned \"strain\" (Cannabis concentrate, all high CBD but varying degrees of THC content). I was asked to abstain from ALL cannabis for a few days, and then to consuome only the test strain for the 3 days leading up to my next test. They arrived at my house in a totally inconspicuous white van (I so wanted tie-dye, missed opportunity) and put me through all of the same testing that took place at the original appointment. Drew my blood, and then sent me into my house to consume \"however much I usually would\". They repeated each round of tests immediately, and then I believe 60 minutes later. A lot of remembering lists (I am clearly not as smart as Trunk, because I kept forgetting my list), and reflex based tests timing my response time with both hands and feet, lifting my foot when I felt a tap, etc. I was excited to be a part of the collection of real data regarding how impaired, or not impaired you are, by cannabis or cbd. In the US we have implemented a system of regulations based on our understanding of alcohol impairment and metabolism. Because the govt put a kabash on research into Marijuana for so long, we are just way behind in knowledge. I am a daily cannabis user. I want to do that responsibly. I also sat on the jury for a \"DWI\" under THC trial. THat was one crazy show to watch. We need some good science on levels of impairment, time after consumption, etc. It was the most ridiculous 3 hours of showboating on the part of the various labs and the lawyers for both sides. That's fascinating, thank you for sharing! I'm not sure if it's the same study or not but I got turned away from a study at cu Boulder for pot  that I was stoked to be in. Oh well. Any chance you could elaborate on the dwi on thc case without putting anyone in trouble? I'm genuinely curious how those go in CO. I sat on a dwi for alcohol case a few years ago but that seemed pretty tame and just amounted to an argument over the process of field sobriety with refusing to take a breathalyzer and wanting blood drawn or something. I forget the details \u201cFindings  In this crossover clinical trial that included 26 healthy participants who underwent on-road driving tests, the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP, a measure of lane weaving, swerving, and overcorrecting) at 40 to 100 minutes following vaporized consumption was 18.21 cm for CBD-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm for THC-dominant cannabis, 21.09 cm for THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and was 18.26 cm for placebo. At 240 to 300 minutes, the SDLP was 19.03 cm for CBD-dominant cannabis, 20.59 cm for THC-dominant cannabis, 19.88 cm for THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis, and 19.37 cm for placebo. Compared with placebo, SDLP with THC-dominant and THC/CBD-equivalent cannabis was significantly greater at 40 to 100 minutes but not 240 to 300 minutes after consumption; there were no significant differences between CBD-dominant cannabis and placebo.\u201d 26 participants and a difference of a centimeter or two between the groups. For reference, highway lanes in my state are about 400cm wide. Where is the control group? Why did the CBD-only group outperform the placebo group? Why is a 26 person study getting this much publicity without ANYONE in the comments mentioning these data? It's a crossover study, they test the same pt on each of the drugs, they are their own control. And the results weren't statistically significant with the CBD group, so there was actually no difference and it didn't outperform controls. But that's fine, we wouldn't expect them the be different. Overall It's that same issue we see all the time with journalism, it gets misinterpreted and overblown. Need more data, but this is a good start. Thank you. CBD has no effect on driving, and(!!) It is extremely important to note that there is no test that indicates 'x' amount of THC in the blood equals a specific amount of impairment. The amount in the blood is entirely dictated on the frequency of use, and is not associated directly with any impairment. For instance, a regular user can test over the legal limits in the State of Washington after not using cannabis for days. They literally just made up a number and ran with it. Tickets for cannabis impairment based on blood quanta should be viewed as voodoo.  This. The government said it to itself in the NHTSA's report to Congress in 2017:  Read page 11, especially the last sentence, \"[This research] does not  show a relationship between THC levels and impairment.\" Full stop. Yeah, tolerance is a massive factor... A daily heavy smoker will be perfectly fine and coordinated and responsive at a dose that would put a normal person into couch lock. For instance, a regular user can test over the legal limits in the State of Washington after not using cannabis for days. They literally just made up a number and ran with it. Because of this, I feel like it would be relatively easy to fight a ticket for cannabis impairment. If THC can be detected in a person's system after not using for days, then there would be no way to legitimately prove   that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the incident. (IANAL) Tickets for cannabis impairment based on blood quanta should be viewed as voodoo. The issue with this approach is that there absolutely needs to be laws against driving while stoned. And for that to happen there needs to be a quantifiable way to check if someone has smoked. Your right, how impaired you are depends on several different factors. How used to the sensation you are, how much chemical tolerance you've built up, your personal reaction to it. But \"But I've got high tolerance\" just cannot be an excuse. It needs to be treated like alcohol, are you stoned at all? That's a DUI. It's the same reason so many people die or get injured from drink-driving. People are poor judges of themselves and instead of accepting that they shouldn't be driving while high or drunk, insist that they are special snowflakes who are totally fine. If I had to drive right this second, I'd not. Like. no. Nope!. I am too high right now. THC's great for non-regimented activities; dancing, yoga, painting, music. Artistic endeavors, where the impairment is intentional in order to foster creativity, to break out of cemented ideas and explore the loose associations generated by overdriven imagination. It turns up the temperature of thought, creates chaos in the mind, and unpredictability. Which diametrically contradicts the principal rule of driving: be  . Maintain speed, keep straight, preconceive each maneuver, eschew spontaneity. The mind must remain on the road, lest it end up on the road. CBD doesn\u2019t impair you no, but this title might mislead some people, anybody whos used cannabis before and has an iq of over 5 would know that marijuana most certainly does impair your driving. Maybe we should stick to driving sober anyways.  10 more years and cars will drive you wherever you want anyways. Elon said this would be happening by 2020, and yet their Tesla's can't even get out of a parking lot. This is an awfully irresponsible and misleading headline. Clinical neuroscience researcher here who specializes in cognitive impairment; let me preface this by saying I am not encouraging \u201cstoned\u201d driving, but from the literature and anecdotal clinical experience, I\u2019m of the belief there are segments of the population who are less \u201cimpaired\u201d when they have THC supplements. We all have an   that is responsible for the processing of cannabinoids (including those produced endogenously or obtained via other means). Unlike say alcohol, which is quite literally metabolized by the body as a toxin, cannabinoids are something our bodies need to function well. THC can and does have medicinal benefits for some people; for some, the supplement will make them healthier/more able. For the majority (non-clinical) populations, it is likely impairing. I\u2019m not doubting the findings of this work, but I\u2019d love to see them investigate before and after THC within the various populations who use cannabis for specific medicinal needs. I believe the future of cannabis science will see specific targeted treatment of deficient cannabinoids in patients, similar to how people need iron or vitamin supplements. Ultimately, I believe that a field sobriety test is of much more value than a blood test in terms of facilitating safe driving. I don\u2019t want anyone too cognitively impaired on the road, whether that\u2019s from age, drugs or sleep deprivation. Edit:  Seems similar to pharmaceutical drugs, many of which advise you not to drive on them until you know how they affect you. I don\u2019t think you necessarily get a DUI for having opiates, benzos, amphetamines in your system, and it\u2019s generally understood that many people drive on such drugs all the time. Definitely more complicated and difficult to measure than booze. Full spec low thc cannabis is medicine. Full stop right there. High THC cannabis also has purpose but come with intoxication. The demonization of cannabis has been extremely detrimental to humanity. It's been used for literally thousands of years, the lower THC higher CBD stuff. Higher THC cannabis came fairly recently, at first with the aid of off-books 'engineers.' There is legit benefit of lower THC high CBD cannabis. If you\u2019re evidently impaired while driving regardless of why, you can be charged. Tiredness included. It\u2019s just a form of reckless driving. If you\u2019re tired but driving fine there\u2019s no crime of course. Meanwhile being tired does and is perfectly legal. Driving while overly tired is actually against the law most places. Driving while being tired is illegal in most places, if not all of the US. Meanwhile being tired does and is perfectly legal. It\u2019s actually not. If a cop pulls you over, and you tell them you\u2019re tired. You\u2019re gonna get in trouble. If you can\u2019t safety drive, regardless of what you\u2019re smoking or drinking or feeling, you\u2019ll get in trouble. Yeah you get DWI\u2019d in Canada if you\u2019re tired, just the same as if you were drunk. EDIT : DWI = Driving While Impaired Meanwhile being tired does and is perfectly legal Please, inform yourself before writing anything online. I believe some states include DUIs for any substance.   So if you were drowsy from antihistamines you could be charged.  But they would have to prove it was from the antihistamines so I guess, don't admit to it taking allergy medicine and just claim you were sleepy. Please make this title more clear to those who think it's the same as THC Isn't this like saying the water in Beer doesn't effect your driving? Yes it is so? You can drink water and drive IIT - People who now think it's now ok to smoke and drive. this is gonna make some selfish idiots think its ok to drive while high If they don\u2019t know the difference between THC and non-psychoactive cannabinoids, which is the topic, maybe. This type of misleading title can lead to actual deaths THC is what impairs. If anything it causes extreme paranoia in drivers. To some extent some may prefer cautious drivers over drunk and erratic drivers. Cannabidiol in cannabis does not impair driving, landmark study shows ...however, lack of sleep, anxiety, anger, fear, high-levels of adrenaline, inability to focus, texting, talking on the phone, arguing with passengers, etc... all   seriously impair driving and there's no major initiatives to curb 90% of those issues. There are though, plenty of states now require you to be hands free. In some states you are required to take your medications to drive if you could be a danger if you came off of it like Siezures, ADHD, Anxiety, etc. Just because you don't see people out in the streets and writing articles about it doesn't mean no one is thinking about it. Is there a major initiative to curb CBD? This study found that THC   impair driving. What? How could there be an initiative against driving with adrenaline? You understand people can\u2019t control that right? There is literally no initiative to stop CBD users from driving, whereas for some of the things you listed (texting while driving, talking on the phone, being overly tired) do have systems out there to stop them There\u2019s no major initiative to treat anxiety, inability to focus, or sleep deprivation??? Being in the phone while driving is already a fat ticket, but how do you suggest \u2018curbing\u2019 the other problems? Should we all have bio-monitors installed checking our adrenal and fear levels?? Think about that kind of stuff before blaming the system. And a ton of pharma drugs impair you as well and they are rarely mentioned for some reason.  $$ As a CBD user this sounds like great news but is the source really without bias? Sometimes if you look hard enough for the data you want you find it. I\u2019m not questioning the methods, just maybe the who and why the study was done. it looks like a reasonably unbiased source as for the why it was done\u2014if CBD-based painkillers are going to be on the market, you need to know if you have to write driving-related notices on the box as for many strong pain killers, etc \u201cThe results should reassure people using CBD-only products that they  are most likely safe to drive, while helping patients using  THC-dominant products to understand the duration of impairment.\u201d It\u2019s an unbiased source. Also worth noting that THC still causes impairment, whilst CBD may not. It\u2019s actually a really important question here in Australia, because while it is now legal to be prescribed cannabis preparations as medical treatment, it is illegal to drive with detectable amounts on random drug testing- ie, if you are prescribed cbd, you cannot legally drive. As such, this is why this study was done, as the implications for users of medicinal cannabis in Australia is significant, and is a major factor in consenting to treatment with these medicines. The sponsor behind that research sounds extremely biased, and if it was a tobacco or alcohol company, instead of a CBD university spin-off, people would be griping about it non-stop. That said the research was not conducted by the biased sponsor but by a different university and published in JAMA so one should hope it's reliable study. It was an article in JAMA, which is about as top tier of a scientific journal you can get.  One aspect that wasn't mentioned is that the dosing seemed pretty low.  It wasn't clear to me if that was the entire dose or not.  Other studies have dosed CBD up to 400 mg and reported slight feelings of intoxication. Although weed affects your driving, comparing it to the effects of alcohol is misguided, and studies have shown impairment can widely vary by tolerance and other factors. I\u2019m impaired right now! I feel like we all knew this, am I wrong? Dr looking a little sus I\u2019m waiting for a study to come out regarding CBG and delta-8-THC ! \ud83e\udd27 Friendly reminder that CBD does literally nothing without THC. Don't smoke and drive. What\u2019s fascinating is that even the THC dominant intoxication had a 2.33cm Standard Deviation of Lane Position (SDLP). The test is calibrated with BAC of 0.05% (legal limit in Australia, having a 2.4cm SDLP. Meaning that being intoxicated with THC dominant cannabis driving 40 mins post inhalation, you are no more dangerous than someone at the legal BAC limit. Hopefully this can inform more commons sense road laws surrounding cannabis consumption. Isn't THC a cannabidiol? Someone is going to read this and think smoking a fat blunt while driving is just fine The amount of people in this thread who don\u2019t know the difference between cannabidiol and THC is a bit concerning Interesting... on another note, perhaps I should do a mini-AMA on the stoned driving study I participated in on behalf of the Canadian government prior to legalization of cannabis in autumn 2018. The Canadian government got us stoned, paid for delivery food, and had us drive an incredibly realistic driving simulator. Good times. *Read the full article - headline should lead with \u201cCBD\u201d since that\u2019s what we\u2019re all used to calling it n=14? \u0391nd people are hyped about this? This isn\u2019t a study, this is clickbait Shoulda stopped the comments at 420 Far too many people will cite this as science proving you can drive while high. Well, yeah. CBD does basically nothing. Who the hell thought it would impair driving? It does nothing and so much at the same time, it's awesome Cannabidiol is CBD, one chemical in cannabis. THC is a different chemical in cannabis and does impair driving. Different strains of cannabis have different amounts of each. And while we're at it, hemp and marijuana are both forms of the cannabis plant, and there are many strains of each. Hemp by definition has very little THC. Marijuana by definition has at least a little THC, sometimes quite a lot. And CBD oils contain no thc. Wow it\u2019s almost like CBD doesn\u2019t do anything at all If you have anxiety, it does a lot. Like a 0.25mg Alprazolam almost for me. Wow it's almost like the world doesn't revolve around your personal experiences alone. It's a proven anti-inflammatory with peer reviewed science showing it to be effective at treating IBD and some types of seizure disorders. There is also evidence of benefit for certain types of chronic pain, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders... I could have told you that.... In another landmark study, hops in beer don't impair driving, the alcohol does Although it was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Australia and the Netherlands did this study.  These types of studies are usually banned in America.  American politicians want full deniability of any knowledge of anything pertaining to marijuana so they can make decisions based purely on polls or morals.  They find facts irritating and distracting and will do a lot to avoid them. They're not banned but because of the federal schedule 1 status it's almost impossible to obtain authorization to conduct medical research because the definition of schedule 1 means that the substance has \"no medical value.\" I believe very select universities have authorization to do research on cannabis and I'm not sure about private entitites The water in beer doesn\u2019t get you drunk These studies need to continue. And impairment needs to be the focus as the current system doesnt work and cannabis will be legalized soon. Its insane people can get in trouble for smoking days or weeks earlier and still be charged because its in their system. Alochol limits exist because there is an understanding between consumption and impairment. Today in overtly misleading headlines. Landmark news: Decaffeinated coffee doesn't keep you up all night! this is a really dangerous article Anyone who has ever taken CBD will tell you it has zero psychoactive effects. It simply helps with a myriad of ailments. I've smoked for years and DO get impaired while driving high, trust! I wouldn't have expected it to... As long as THC is not present it should be fine. This tweet is misleading and may be harmful. I've been smoking pot for 20 years. Being high makes you a MUCH worse driver. Any stoner already knows this I was born in Switzerland, and while regular weed isn't available for sale (the consumption of it is legal on your property I believe), weed that has been specifically bred to have high CBD/low THC content is available even in corner shops now. I believe you're allowed to drive after having smoked CBD weed there. ", "Science"], "Topic": "Science"},
{"No-kill, lab-grown meat to go on sale for first time": ["I remember hearing about 10 years ago it would take like 10 years to bring lab-grown meat to market, and here we are. Fusion Energy in shambles.... It isn't close to markets. It just has approval in singapore. Can't possibly come soon enough.  I'm aaaaaall over it when it becomes available. Impossible Beef is already here and it's identical in taste and texture EDIT: what I have shared here is an  . Like any statement regarding taste is. Chill out everyone Whoa, this is a wild statistic. \"By weight, 60% of the mammals on earth are livestock, 36% are humans and only 4% are wild.\" Damn, that's ridiculous! well that's only mammals. if you extend it to all animals then the wild is much larger - total insects weigh more than total humans. the other thing about it is that mammals we eat are large from their diet, lack of exercise, breeding, and hormones while the mammals that are wild are going to be much smaller - think squirrles, rats, etc. while things like elephants and rhinos are the outliers and there's not many of them. so you'll never see a wild cow but even if you did they likely wouldn't be as large as the domesticate ones. I find that horrifying. Not because of the ethical implications, more of the \u201coh shit we\u2019re almost entirely alone\u201d implications. I wanna try it \ud83d\ude2d Like its not vegan, but it is?? Worth noting that as of yet the lab grown meat isn't vegan because it still requires taking cells from the animals. As far as I'm aware, you still need starter cells, which means even if this becomes prominent it would cut down but not eliminate the need for factory farming. Of course, I say this as someone who simply eats whatever's in the fridge, and doesn't particularly do vegan anyway, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f just letting people know. You're confused about what veganism is. The fact that the cells come from animals don't make it non-vegan. Veganism is a philosophy centered against animal cruelty and exploitation. \"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude\u2014as far as is possible and practicable\u2014all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.\" The biggest hurdle cell grown meat has for veganism is animal serum, so far a lot of these cultures use animal serum to grow cells whereas some labs are already developing plant-based ones. \"The clean meat industry is racing to ditch its reliance on foetal blood\" But once you have those cells can\u2019t you take the cells from the lab meat and therefore no animals was harmed in the making of the second batch. Besides this isn\u2019t for the vegan looking to eat meat market. This is for the meat eater who gave up meat but didn\u2019t want to because of its cost or detriment to the environment. No meat substitute product is marketed for a vegan or vegetarian. It\u2019s marketed for someone who eats a lot of meat to replace a new or two a week Well not necessarily. From 1 biopsy you would produce a master cell stock in a large volume( e.g. 50.000 ltrs) and store it in very little vials. And from each of these vials you would be able to produce working cell stocks in the same manner. And these working cell stocks might then be used one by one for the production of the meat - meaning that you could run probably 100thousands of cultivations from one biopsy. When you scale up the production vessels high enough for higher meat production per cultivation, this should be a neglectable problem. However, the aspect of not being totally vegan might still stand because at the end the cells were coming at some day from an animal, though you cannot really state that it was severely harmed. I mean, I guess. But you\u2019d be improving our meat productivity by, like, several orders of magnitude. And with such astronomical productivity gains, you eliminate the need for such vicious, high-throughput factory farming. Animals could be provided some semblance of QoL for most of their life. I mean, this would be like 50-75 years into a massive success story, and we\u2019d have to ask what are we gunna do about the massive existing livestock population, but idk. But yes, at the beginning of the production chain will still be a commodified animal body, which will be slain. Nothing changing that so far as I can see No, it is vegan. How is it that growing this lab grown meat includes \u201cfoetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood\u201d, and yet this is being promoted as free of animal treatment issues? I hope it reduces animal mistreatment. Cells from one donor cow cultuted in labs rather than a billion cows is like a billionth of the suffering. How is it that growing this lab grown meat includes \u201cfoetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood\u201d, and yet this is being promoted as free of animal treatment issues? People are dumb. its a nothingkilled burger! Fetal cows are killed for this process. Anyone knows what's the CO2 impact of growing meat like that compared to raising animals? edit: Seems CO2 might be worse (but as usual depends on how the energy needed here is produced), Methane better, less water and land needed and in general the numbers are not in yet as this stuff is too new:  For one, researchers assumed humanity wouldn\u2019t decarbonize energy production in that time period\u2014meaning we\u2019d still be burning fossil fuels to power the plants that produce in vitro meat Looking at the impact in 1000 years and assuming that decarbonizing energy production won't happen seem like 2 very weird decisions here. It's a lot easier to decarbonize energy production than to nullify livestock GHG emissions. What if we just like, idk, ate plants instead \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Tastes like chicken ? Could taste like strawberry.  I bet we will see some wild combos in the next decade. On the other hand. Would I enjoy something with a beef texture and fruity taste? Must be weird the first time. Does this address any of the environmental concerns about eating higher up the food chain?  It's not clear from this piece. For those of you saying that it\u2019s not cruelty-free, they say in the article that they take the cells from biopsies of live animals. How is it better for the environment if we have to build factories to produce and process fake meat? Where do all the raw materials come from and how are the sourced? Yeah mate. Just eat plants. People don't like this answer, but it's the most sensible one. It's not cruelty free. It's grown from the blood of baby cow hearts.  Not for much longer. I think all these companies know that the supply of FBS is not enough to sustain large scale production. The cells used to start the process came from a cell bank and did not require the slaughter of a chicken because cells can be taken from biopsies of live animals. The nutrients supplied to the growing cells were all from plants. The growth medium for the Singapore production line includes foetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood, but this is largely removed before consumption. A plant-based serum would be used in the next production line, the company said, but was not available when the Singapore approval process began two years ago. I need a more reliable source than the website you linked before I can decide if it's cruelty free or not. Is it just me or does chicken and beef seem like a waste of this tech? What did a dodo taste like? Or a sea turtle? Or all the other things people ate/are eating to extinction. How about Chinese medicine? Would they accept rhino horn and pangolin scale grown in lab? And I have to imagine someone is pitching creepy billionaires on the idea of lab grown long pig. Imo, get crazy with it later. First, let's stop mass killing billions of animals annually that are repeatedly bred and forced to endure factory farms because are they currently suffering while the others are already gone or \"off limits\". Then create whatever animal the heart, er stomach, desires lol Though I love the idea of moving forward with weird lab grown things used in traditional medicines. In all reality, it's probably a cost thing. More people are likely to buy beef practically continuously rather than occasionally try something exotic once in a while. People like to eat what they grew up with. As for long pig, there's already been a few non-human based renditions, so I'm sure it'll happen lol there was even a guy on reddit who got to take his amputated leg home from the hospital and cook it and eat it with his friends (search on Google and you'll get the thread. Be warned the images are graphic). Apparently we taste yummy which isn't really a surprise imo. It's likely that they need living cells to reproduce, so they can compare the clone cell to the original. Something like that, I'm not a scientist. But it is well documented what the dodo tasted like, general consensus was it wasn't great tasting. It was in the pigeon family, so the taste is likely similar if you wanted to give it a try. The dodo became extinct for alot of reasons, but it being delicious wasn't one of them. It had no natural predators prior to humans and only laid one egg at a time to reproduce, it was doomed the minute the careless hungry sailors set foot on the same land. Most of the things that we've hunted to extinction wasn't because of the irresistible taste, it's our greed. So it's really not worth the work to bring it back just to eat, we need to sort out the problem of factory farming first. Are you a writer? Because you have the outline of a great story right there How about trying human meat if it\u2019s grown in a reactor? Well no, you\u2019re wrong. This technology costs a lot. Billions of animals are getting slaughtered every year for our tastebuds, let\u2019s try and reduce that suffering instead of focusing on turtle and what not that almost nobody eats anyway. Focusing on sea turtle and your other tastebud fantasies would be the waste here. What a bad idea. All ahil Margaret Atwood, Chickynubs are here How much is it? Being completely ignorant of this, are there any downsides to eating this meat compared to regular meat? What does it say about us as a species that only when the most advanced, closest-you-could-get-to-meat option requiring the   amount of personal sacrifice is available will we be willing to change our behavior to make an impact on our planet and the creatures that inhabit it? So is it vegan? Those cells are alive and you are killing them.  I am not against lab grown meat, but its hardly deathless. no-kill [...] The growth medium for the Singapore production line includes foetal bovine serum, which is extracted from foetal blood And where do you think that freshly-squeezed calf juice comes from, ya dingus? Do you have a source? I don't see how animal meat can be grown using plant cells because in order to grow the meat because the scientists have to mimic the nutrients and cells of  a womb of an animal for the meat to grow. This is cool but I find as an \"aspiring\" ethical vegetarian the hardest thing to replace is CHEESE.  Which is funny because substitutes are performing technological miracles to mimic the texture and mouthfeel of meat fibers, which seems harder, to me, than a homogenous block of cheese. Why has fake meat come so far but fake cheese still a hard pass? Then go find one if you're not satisfied. \ud83e\udd22 Disgusting, what flavors can they replicate? Pheasant, rabbit, duck?    \ud83d\ude01 I want!! What's the macros?! Woo Aww yiss, here we go, it's the start of the future! I won't eat GMO produce, so I'm going to give this shit a wide berth. And this is how we get zombies. Cuz, 2020. Username checks out People should develop a taste for liver, they\u2019d be healthier if they ate more organs and not simply muscle meat. Nah rather have real meat. As long as it doesn't cause an increased percentage of cancer in people that eat this lab-grown meat vs organic meat and tastes at least close to the original then this could be great. No meat is your best bet against cancer. So what exactly are you putting in your body then? Cultivated meat cells. Cue the zombie apocalypse in five, four... For those objecting, we still barely understand protein structure and formation, folding, so synthetically grown material like this could have long term health effects that are unforeseen. For reference, how much do we understand mad cow disease? rabies? Any introduction like this can open the door to contamination of chronic poisoning, maybe if we could figure out how to cure the diseases we already have we could start to synthesize food at this level. Rabies is caused by a Virus, which has nothing to do with growing animal cells. Mad Cow Disease   caused by Prion, but if anything lab grown meat would be safer from the disease. I don\u2019t think you know what\u2019s happening here, \u2018synthesizing\u2019 meat this way is just growing cells, they\u2019re not making new types of meat or protein or some shit. This is great, hope they will be able to bring the price way down though. This doesn't  necessary need to replace the high quality meat, but rather the cheap stuff that's most cruelly and environmentally unfriendly sourced. Vegetarians are divided about this lol. I\u2019m on the side of thinking it\u2019s ethical but yucky and I\u2019m not going to eat it. Some of my friends have been waiting for it so they can eat meat again without the negatives. I think it will be a good thing for the world in general. Nothing has died in the production of this meat. Only them cells tho. If it tastes the same, I'll 100% eat it instead of real chicken bites. I won't be stopping eating roast chicken though. Probably doesn't, since fat carries the taste. I think they are doing only lean meat but I can be wrong. If we can get off fossil fuels and shift meat production to lab-grown that'll put a huge dent in our carbon emissions. We need to have both of these done by 2030. No excuses.

{"U.N. Reclassifies Cannabis as a Less Dangerous Drug": ["Great news. Hopefully a lot of good research comes out of it. It's good and bad. It means the pharmaceutical companies and the FDA are sure to strong arm their way into it. Putting the brave people who fought for the legalization out of business. The most dangerous thing about weed is getting caught with it. I've said this for years, and it's true. But I'm also ready to reclassify this claim when it becomes truly legal everywhere. Once weed is truly legal, I'll be able to say that these are the issues with using it, and discuss responsible use. None of them are as bad as the anti-drug people make them out to be, so the discussion doesn't really get anywhere as long as they're still pulling that shit. But once they finally lose and let it be legal, then we can talk about the issues with using it too early in life, using it chronically, using it in high doses chronically, long term chronic use and other legitimate aspects of use. It's the same as sugar. If sugar was illegal the worst thing about it would be the dangers of getting caught with it. But with sugar legal we can instead talk about the risks of too much. Eating too much can make you fat. Eating sugar can rot your teeth. Even without getting fat, it changes your blood sugar level. That has a cascade effect on your body. Etc. There are legitimate considerations for using sugar. Same with pot. But we can't even discuss things like stunting your emotional maturity because you started smoking daily at 11 because even mentioning this has people thinking you're in the pro-prohibition camp with the zealots. I work as a nurse on a mental health unit, while IMHO, weed is definitely far from the worse, it can still help induce or increase psychotic symptoms or increase depressive symptoms in many people especially if you already have a mental health issue. So if one can chose, you should pick cbd and not thc. However, if you want to get fucked up in your head, have full blown psychosis and meeting people like me, do take meth/amphetamines. This will definitely mess you up way more. (obviously, I'm excluding psychostimulants prescribed by you doctor in proper dosage.) In Canada the most dangerous thing about weed here is to stuff the bag upside down in your pocket and end up with a pocket full of weed and weed full of lint and pocket crumbs. My mom still considers it a gateway drug. And i wish we would just have edibles that way it\u2019s super safe and doesn\u2019t have the harmful lung effects from smoking.

Been a week and I still have anxiety, I feel like my body is in a constant fight or flight response and my chest feels very 'airy' and butterflies in my stomach. It's also difficult to sleep like this. I feel/think like I have extreme health problems and my heart will fail (I turned into hypochondriac) while I consciously know that is totally not true, I am perfectly healthy besides these feelings. This is with very heavy use though, a gram or more daily for years. With that, I think getting caught with it here in NJ is still a lot worse and will fuck up your life way more than anxiety. It also causes chs which is excruciating stomach pain but it is not very common. I probably will smoke again one day but not anytime in the foreseeable future.. This is the best tl;dr I could make,   reduced by 80%. (I'm a bot) Dec. 2, 2020, 6:11 a.m. ET.A United Nations commission voted on Wednesday to remove cannabis for medical use from a category of the world's most dangerous drugs, such as heroin, a highly anticipated and long-delayed decision that could clear the way for marijuana research and medical use. \"We will have the U.N., the main drug policy body, recognizing the medical usefulness of cannabis,\" he said ahead of the vote. The overhaul of cannabis policy, particularly around legalization for medical use, has moved at a rapid pace over the last few years, said Jessica Steinberg, managing director at the Global C, an international cannabis consulting group, who has attended U.N. meetings.  |   |   |    :          So funny that Weed and Heroin were classed together but Pharmaceutical use of opiates has remained so prevalent and Pot has been so neglected. The schedules described here and NOT the same as the DEA's in the USA. The fact that cannabis was on a list of dangerous drugs in the first place is absurd atleast in one category with heroin etc, I mean cmon, its weed Why is the UN classifying drugs in the first place? The UN has 4 main purposes: To keep peace throughout the world To develop friendly relations among nations To help nations work together to improve the lives of poor people, to conquer hunger, disease and illiteracy, and to encourage respect for each other\u2019s rights and freedoms To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations to achieve these goals Guys marijuana is really dangerous. If a person smokes 20,000 joints in 15 minutes they can die. That 50s \u201cweed kills brain cells\u201d study was done by pumping constant smoke into a gas mask worn by a monkey. It\u2019s easier to OD from \u201ctoo much smoke, not enough air\u201d than \u201ctoo much smoke, too much THC in bloodstream\u201d Let us not forget to inform all the helicopter parents that it\u2019s not due to weed, it\u2019s due to a lack of oxygen that kills you. Don\u2019t need any parents in here reading this going \u201cmy Danny boy is a super smoker, he probably could smoke that much in 15 minutes\u201d. It\u2019s ridiculous that we have to inform them Close one. Challenge accepted For real it's less dangerous than Advil And even then it\u2019s not the weed that kills you. It\u2019s all that deeeelicious cookie dough Also if you eat a pot brownie you could choke on it and die that way! I\u2019ve heard of lolly popping, but those boys in that picture gave those girls the full high bald fade. Pretty damn early too.  No fluff buds for them I guess? Exactly, far too extreme...and they also lost a month vegging them so big in the first place The fact that entire nations were ok with pretending cannabis was harmful shows you everything you need to know about people in power. About the people that   in power, and the uninformed inertia of public support they mustered decades ago. Some ban-hammer-happy powerful racists make weed super-illegal and convinced a huge section of the public to go along with it. Now I would be surprised if anyone in power   cares about weed, half of them regularly do much more powerful stuff, what they think is that being anti-weed is a vote winner in some circles. As this becomes less and less true and the court of public opinion turns in favor of weed, power will follow. But there's NO way they'd ever use that same tactic with other mediums outside of pot.. /s DUIs are still a problem, if we learned anything its people drink and drive so we will have the same problem with this. Im all for it, but we need to hold people accountable. Just make it legal already. Tired of hiding and smoking It is not the hiding bit that bothers me. I can always smoke in the comfort of my home. What really bothers me is access to it. The fact that I need to go to a dealer and support a criminal network in order to get the stuff, and you also buy something you don\u2019t know what it is. There a a plethora of strains that effects you in different ways. And add to that you don\u2019t know what chemicals that have been used on it during the growing. I just want to go to a normal shop, browse around, get what I want and pay for it. Legal in Canada. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Good stuff I UN Thank you for dropping the schedule of marijuana It makes ZERO sense as to why it was in the first place It makes ZERO sense as to why it was in the first place Money and control. Plain and simple. America was settled by puritans and that way of life still lingers today! I'm an american in oklahoma and have a medical card! My statement still stands that puritan values still linger today! Because Nixon couldn't make being a hippie or a civil rights protester or being black illegal,  Regan ramped the whole thing up to 11 and now we have an entire prison industrial complex to fight against decriminalization of largely harmless plants. Read this book, it will explain what happened. Actually it was a very effective way to control people of color and poor economic standing. Look into William Randald Hurst. Capitalism x Bigotry I hope psychedelics will follow Also for these substances, it makes no sense it makes sense if you know the history of it! Obvious.  Weed makes you see.  It removes the anxiety that the overlords impose on you. Because of pressure from the US. I wonder if this is an early sign of the States losing some of its global influence. Getting closer.  Fact is, cannabis is more correctly classified as a useful plant, with an extremely favorable safety profile. Now do psilocybin. Psychedelics in general. But i think its wiser to start with the natural ones (mescaline, dmt and psilocybin) because people they have less stigma and thousands of years of safe use. Shrooms are an amazing drug. Had severe anxiety growing up and high school was the worst. Also had fear of animals and insects. Started experimenting with Psilocybin and pretty much made me stop giving a fuck about being anxious and I pick up lizards and frogs up without freaking out. Though if youre not ready for it, it can be self destructive if you bullshit yourself. Best analogy I heard was \"its like taking a big mental shit, four months of therapy in four hours.\" And do LSD, MDMA, 2C-B, DMT, 4-Aco-DMT, 5-Meo-DMT, mescaline, LSA, ETH-LAD, etc Great, so governments with all their resources are just figuring out what we all knew.  Better late than never I guess. governments [...] just figuring out what we all knew do not mistake corruption for incompetence. Great, so governments with all their resources are just   admitting what we all knew because a business model is in play. Sometimes I like to plagiarize and add a few of my own words. As much as I want to see the new marijuana industry not be dominated by big ag/pharma i cant wait to smoke the super weed monsanto is working on Just...no. Big corps will never do it as well as the small time growers. And that\u2019s a good thing. And yet GA will arrest you for possession of any amount. Mindblowing Iowa is right there with you. Bye-bye boomers. Times are changing. the green wave is upon us The tides are high today It\u2019s insane how the four legal plants I have growing 5 feet away from me has put so many people in jail yet it\u2019s no where near as dangerous as alcohol. What strains? I recently started growing and it's actually really sad that cannabis has been outlawed the way it has. It's such a beautiful plant. And it has missed out on decades of proper scientific breeding. Imagine the medicine and quality of herb we'd be growing if people were allowed to really study this plant. What\u2019s more dangerous- THC or Alcohol (ethanol)? Asking for a friend. Alcohol withdrawal can kill you real fast Alcohol. Alcohol is by far the more dangerous drug, by many orders of magnitude. It's effects on people's bodies, on their behaviour, and on society writ large are astronomically worse than the impacts of cannabis. What makes it worse, in my view, is that alcohol is socially revered. We celebrate its effects, we glamorize it, we joke with our friends and colleagues about how much we need it, we laugh at  people who are severely intoxicated by it, we gloss over the damaging effects it has on ourselves and others, we think of it as a go-to solution to stressful life situations, we create cute language (e.g. mommy needs her wine!) to soften what is an addictive and dangerous drug. Alcohol is one of the few drugs that, in many cultures, you need an excuse *not* to use. Cannabis is not harmless, but it is not in the same league as alcohol. If you were objectively examining cannabis and alcohol and deciding which one should be illegal, no reasonable person would have concluded cannabis. Both have their risks, but weed doesn't kill. The NHS did a great study on lots of drugs finding their harm to self, harm to others, risk of abuse, etc. It's the source to go to for now and the right way to think about these things. The harms to the individual were: drug-specific mortality drug-related mortality drug-specific damage drug-related damage dependence drug-specific impairment of mental functioning drug-related impairment of mental functioning loss of tangibles (income, housing, job etc) loss of relationships The harms to others were: injury crime environmental damage family adversities international damage economic cost community The only dangerous thing about weed is getting caught with it Alchohol is definitely more dangerous. Alcohol. I don\u2019t think anyone denies that alcohol is more dangerous, but that doesn\u2019t mean that weed not harmful. There are multiple studies that show the negative effects that weed have. So why should we make something that is proven harmful legal? And yes regarding some cases like cancer and chronic pain, weed has proven useful and I think that it should be an option for the patient. But I\u2019m pretty certain that the majority of weed consumers don\u2019t suffer from cancer or chronic pain, they just want to get high. Alcohol is worse If cannabis is a drug, so is coffee and alcohol I mean.. they are... Caffeine is also a less dangerous drug, wonder if same category There's gotta be an alternate universe where coffee is banned and stoners meet up in secret to drink it, meanwhile congressmen smoke week for breakfast lmao. Conservative  Americans are why cannabis was outlawed world wide. They forced marijuana prohibition on America and then strong armed other countries into following suit. And yet drug loving Americans still vote conservative to own the Social Justice Warriors they hate so much. It is more because of the tobacco companies paying big bucks to show cannabis in bad light and paying politicians to shut down any attempt of legalization. Fucking Americans. This is entirely incorrect. Weed prohibition had began before america was really even a legitimate country. People would bring marijuana products back from southeast asia, africa, and the middle east into europe which led to places such as france banning hashish. Pls dont be a dumbass and act like the USA is the only country to ever be shitty or racist or really bad about laws or whatever. U kinda just make urself look like a 12 year old who just started watching dr who or something. MAGA should be classified as a detrimental substance The depressing thing is that today, at least at the federal level, it's a bipartisan effort to keep it outlawed. Now do LSD, DMT and Psilocybin! The 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances is a joke. the main reason im even on reddit is that if i try to go without an account i always really wanna upvote these pot posts... so here goes This article gets one thing wrong: Experts say that the vote will have no immediate impact on loosening international controls because governments will still have jurisdiction over how to classify cannabis. But many countries look to global conventions for guidance, and United Nations recognition is a symbolic win for advocates of drug policy change who say that international law is out of date. Actually the 1961 Single Convention is a non-self-executing treaty, meaning that being party to it requires the state to pass legislation in support of it's terms. The 1970 Controlled Substances Act in the US, and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the UK, are both laws that were passed to comply with Single Convention obligations. Not that the US cares at all, but prior to this reclassification process rescheduling cannabis in the Single Convention, if the US had decriminalized cannabis federally they would have been in violation of their international obligations under the Single Convention. This is actually a HUGE step forward as now every state party to the Single Convention can update their laws accordingly. TLDR; This move essentially removes the international pressure to treat cannabis like a dangerous drug, and allows states parties to relax their cannabis laws with no UN/INCB pressure against. Specifically medical cannabis could now be legalized and regulated in most countries around the world. They need to do this with mushrooms and peyote. If more ppl were tripping and having these spiritual experiences I believe the world would be a much better and happier place. Granted everyone would be spun the fuck out but theirs minds would be opened up Oregon just passed a bill that allows  psilocybin mushrooms for use in treatment. We became the party state with legal weed and shrooms. Cool now liberate China how does the UN classify ethanol? If it's not at least classified as a 'more dangerous drug' then the UN is even more of a joke, given the literally overwhemling consensus that alcohol is more addictive, does more societal harm, causes more overdoses and deaths, etc. Not to mention alcohol is a group 1 carcinogen. Let plants be plants and make laws about the use, banning plants is beyond retarded. As long as they call it a drug big pharma is getting what they want. Only about 60 years too late. tf took the idiots so long? Cool, now do alcohol if pot is still \"dangerous.\" YSK that Marijuana is a sacred herb in Hindu mythology. Lord Shiva used to consume it with his chillum. Unfortunately this became a banned substance even in India due to politics. While we can and certainly should debate the harmful effects and addiction, it has been found that it isn\u2019t as addictive or harmful as other recreational drugs. Taken in moderation, it really helps to calm the mind down. Don't people in India still consume Cannabis in the form of bhang? Is that also illegal? It is dangerous for my diet \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1d Damn at first I read this as the US. Bitch McConnell needs to die so we can have nice things I'm sorry but I think there's a typo in your comment. It should be Bitch McFuckface. I'll smoke to that \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf3f Why do those plants look like bonsai trees? They may want to hire someone who knows that they\u2019re doing. Mother plants - plants held in pre-flowering state to provide clone cuttings that are grown to flower - can often look like bonsai plants, I saw one in the Netherlands many years ago. They know what they're doing, but you just assume it's wrong because   don't know what they're doing lol. Puff Puff Puff...  but we're not there yet. To think that all of that suffering and injustice is mostly the product of racist and cultural supremacism considerations... Too many innocents died as the result of these pointless laws. Cannabis needs to be removed from any scheduled substance list. Why is it classified as dangerous at all? It was a political move to throw those that disagreed with Nixon in jail. Reagan later cranked it up for his own reasons. Drug schedules aren't actually related to the potential benefits/harmful effects of a substance. Because the negative side effects outweigh the positive gained from consuming the drug. Reading this thread just makes it obvious people tend to forget what drugs actually do to your psyche over a little bit of fun... So when it's convenient for you??? Fuck off un and any bs govt that peddled alcohol, nicotine and meds on every street corner for over a century. Fuck research and benefits of drugs. Just let me do drug  regardless man. Lsd won\u2019t cure shit for me, it just makes watching Sfx in movies really fun. Why do we need research of medicinal benefits when it\u2019s just fun. Weed probably harms you more than it helps. That  fine IMO. Cause Alcohol does the same and I can buy that across the block but I gotta go on the outskirts of town to buy legal weed. Come one man. Weed isn\u2019t dangerous? of course it is. So what, I never gotten high enough to feel as shitty as I did drinking two four locos and you can get that at 711. Excellent. Next step is to classify it as (mostly) harmless plant. Step by steady step. Advil is more dangerous than weed. Like alcohol and nicotine aren't worse... Thanks UN. Maybe now they can backtrack on the war against Psychedelics its happening..... Cmon Congress\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e My weed stocks :) pls continue. It is nice to see these organisations and Governments finally catch up with the Stoners. Drug test this guy NOW HOW ABOUT WHO CARES OF THE MEDICAL USE? HOW ABOUT IT'S JUST FUN? AND NOT DANGEROUS IN ANY WAY What do they classify alcohol as? Is caffeine classified? It's about fucking time. Yeah it\u2019s pretty much medicine Bout fucking time Great! Now hopefully the US will drop it\u2019s schedule classification soon. I\u2019m interested to see the research that comes out about THC, especially looking more deeply into the links between it and increased psychosis or anxiety symptoms. I used to smoke weed. I still do, but i used to, to I\u2019m so sick of this pussyfooting the world does with marijuana... just make it fucking legal for Christ sake Meanwhile just sitting here ordering magic mushrooms online in Canada Everyone can thank NJ for this. Seems like ever since NJ legalized federal courts and the international courts followed suit. I\u2019m kidding but it\u2019s was weird timing. It\u2019s not a drug. It\u2019s a plant. And it was put on this planet to heal humanity. \"U.N. Reclassifies Cannabis as a Less Dangerous Drug A United Nations commission voted to remove marijuana for medical use from a list of the most risky narcotics, such as heroin. Tending crops at a marijuana plantation in North Macedonia. Tending crops at a marijuana plantation in North Macedonia.Credit...Loulou d'Aki for The New York Times Isabella Kwai By Isabella Kwai Dec. 2, 2020 Updated 10:10 a.m. ET A United Nations commission voted on Wednesday to remove cannabis for medicinal purposes from a category of the world\u2019s most dangerous drugs, a highly anticipated and long-delayed decision that could clear the way for an expansion of marijuana research and medical use. The vote by the Commission for Narcotic Drugs, which is based in Vienna and includes 53 member states, considered a series of recommendations from the World Health Organization on reclassifying cannabis and its derivatives. But attention centered on a key recommendation to remove cannabis from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs \u2014 where it was listed alongside dangerous and highly addictive opioids like heroin. Experts say that the vote will have no immediate impact on loosening international controls because governments will still have jurisdiction over how to classify cannabis. But many countries look to global conventions for guidance, and United Nations recognition is a symbolic win for advocates of drug policy change who say that international law is out of date. \u201cThis is a huge, historic victory for us, we couldn\u2019t hope for more,\u201d said Kenzi Riboulet-Zemouli, an independent researcher for drug policy who has closely monitored the vote and the position of member states. He said that cannabis had been used throughout history for medicinal purposes and that the decision on Wednesday reinstated that status. The change will most likely bolster medical research and legalization efforts around the world. The vote was a \u201cbig step forward,\u201d recognizing the positive impact of cannabis on patients, said Dirk Heitepriem, a vice president at Canopy Growth, a Canadian cannabis company. \u201cWe hope this will empower more countries to create frameworks which allow patients in need to get access to treatment.\u201d Marijuana for medical use has exploded in recent years and products containing cannabis derivatives like cannabidiol or CBD, a nonintoxicating compound, have flooded the wellness industry. Cowen, an investment and financial services company, estimates that the CBD industry in the United States will be worth $16 billion by 2025. Some research has suggested that CBD can protect the nervous system and provide relief from seizures, pain, anxiety and inflammation. The list of CBD-infused products \u2014 including creams, serums, soda water and juice \u2014 is also expanding rapidly. The recommendations for changing the classification of marijuana were first made by the World Health Organization in 2019. But they were politically divisive, which led to unusual delays in the United Nations commission\u2019s vote. The reclassification passed 27 to 25, with an abstention from Ukraine. The United States and European nations were among those who voted in favor, while the likes of China, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan and Russia were opposed. China\u2019s delegate said that, despite the United Nations move, the country would strictly control cannabis \u201cto protect from the harm and abuse.\u201d Britain\u2019s delegate said that the reclassification was \u201cin line with the scientific evidence of its therapeutic benefits\u201d but that the country still strongly supported international controls for cannabis, adding that marijuana presented \u201cserious public health risks.\u201d The differing messages underline the complexities behind the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s been a diplomatic circus,\u201d said Mr. Riboulet-Zemouli, who added that some countries initially opposed to the change, like France, had since switched their position. Michael Krawitz, executive director for Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access, an advocacy group in the United States, said the change in international law would \u201chelp reduce the suffering millions of people\u201d and could help mitigate reliance on opiates, noting that cannabis was an important medication that could provide unique pain relief. Also on Wednesday, the commission rejected a proposal to include the cannabis derivative THC in the 1961 convention, which would have tightened some controls. The overhaul of cannabis policy, particularly around legalization for medical use, has moved at a rapid pace over the last few years, said Jessica Steinberg, managing director at the Global C, an international cannabis consulting group. Industry insiders have expressed hope that the vote will open the field for more research into the therapeutic benefits of the drug. But the impact on the American and European markets was driving the issue, Ms. Steinberg noted. In the United States, where more states legalized the use of medical and recreational marijuana in the recent election, the market for both of those is expected to expand to more than $34 billion by 2025, according to Cowen. Before the vote this week and other decriminalization efforts, share prices of some cannabis companies jumped. But aside from the financial boon it could provide for American and European marijuana markets, downgrading the dangers of cannabis may have the biggest impact on countries that have more conservative policies, such as many Caribbean and Asian nations. \u201cSomething like this does not mean that legalization is just going to happen around the world,\u201d Ms. Steinberg said. But \u201cit could be a watershed moment.\u201d \" The experts, ladies and gentlemen. This is stupid.. the war on cannabis was only created for profit and to indoctrinate humans.. cannabis should of never been listed as a dangerous drug. Well Done them, hopefully it can be put to medical use, to help people who really need it. This is great. I'm lucky enough to live in Colorado where there are at least three dispensaries within two minutes of my apartment; and as a regular user both medically and recreationally, I can only hope that this paves the way for more innovation. Truly a great day, the UN has finally gained the medical experience of a trailer park hippy in the 1970s. i use cannabis from time to time in various forms, but i still think we need to remember that just because it's becoming more legal, it's still not something we should have around kids, especially in a smoke-able form. second hand smoke is dangerous. That's a fair compromise I'd say. Make it legal but punishable if you smoke round children or in the car with passengers present etc, kinda like how cigarettes are now (disregarding the fact that cigarettes are far more dangerous) I would think edibles/topicals would be more dangerous around children. 5 year old isn't likely to light up a joint. But those cookies or gummies look pretty appealing to a child. i feel the same way cigarettes' but here we are. Is there recent literature showing it\u2019s unhealthy for children? More so than Nighttime Benadryl at least? Not saying it isn\u2019t. I am just skeptical. I\u2019ve been told my entire life it was a schedule 1 drugs (ie NO medicine benefits). And that was obviously bullshit. Why is it still referred to as a drug at all? The fucking government needs to start calling alcohol a drug. You can become dependent on alcohol and the shit will kill you. Marijuana not so much. It\u2019s all about money. They know they couldn\u2019t regulate and tax weed like they do alcohol so piss off with this whole shit show. THC and ethanol are both drugs. That classification isn't related to their potentially harmful/beneficial effects. They absolutely could regulate and tax it. But the tobacco industry keeps paying politicians to keep it out because who the fuck would smoke tobacco if weed was legal? Why dangerous at all? Blood pressure and heart rate increase in addition to various mental stability issues I\u2019d assume Edit: Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (forgot about the big one) Thailand changed laws today also Blame Canada :) \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 Good move. Are those weed bonsais?\ud83d\ude0d Pog! But didn\u2019t we know this already? I just hope good research keeps coming out Everytime I see the word cannabis, I read cannibal. Idiots finally realized. Took them long enough. disable javascript in chrome than reload the page. Fuck the NY Times It\u2019s about damn time That\u2019s a heavy prune...that\u2019s what I take away. how is it dangerous? Why isn\u2019t hemp becoming a thing now it is legal in some/most countries Oh god what did they do to those plants in the banner image? Talk about lollipop ping... Don\u2019t be fooled, they didn\u2019t classify it as \u201cless dangerous\u201d until it was convenient for them to do so. Where is alcohol on the list? About time! Less than 1% and he is doing next \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4 wabbo do dont dingdong Das macht es noch lange nicht zu Brokkoli! Interesting how this news is released after the talks of adding cancer warnings to alcohol products like beer and whiskey have circulated online Reminder, weed should still be taken responsibly. Start with edibles where you can easily control your dosage and start small until you know your tolerance. So many people smoke too much their first time and have a bad experience. It's the equivalent of drinking Everclear straight from the bottle for your first alcoholic beverage. Bad advice, starting with edibles is a recipe for disaster. There are too many factors to consider with edibles. Start with a dry herb vape if you have access to it, even distillate with low THC % can do the trick. Sublingual spray / oil is also more forgiving than edibles, start small. Shouldve been done like 10 years ago but okay.... Corporate Cannabis. Yeees finally!!! This single UN convention or whatever was the main thing the government brought up whenever we had a petition to legalize in our country! Which pissed me off, Canada signed that as well and went ahead with legalization, so why couldn't we?! Now they will at least have to make up their own reasons to keep it illegal instead of citing this 50 year old document back at us again and again. Yay for Weed Stocks! Just look at how happy *most Canadians are ! Thanks captain obvious I smoke everyday...still don't have the urge to try stronger drugs. All those anti drug commercials were   its more like  Article and UN decision aside, how stupid are the growers in the photo? Like what the fuck are those? Butchered the plants lol. Fucking finally. After the US bullied them to upgrade drugs like LSD and marijuana up the list Until cannabis is classified as less dangerous than alcohol and tobacco they can\u2019t be taken seriously. \u270a\ud83c\udffd I guess theyre getting closer to finding a way to effectively tax the shit out of it Damn, the UN itself? Oh wait, noone will care Wow that photo is wholesome af. How does that affect legislation in UN friendly countries? How about not dangerous at all! Great! Now let\u2019s expunge the records of those who were jailed for years. Less dangerous than? Alcohol? Prescription pain killers? No no, they straight up had it on a list that included Heroin.

{"UK approves Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine for mass roll out": ["Around 10m doses should be available soon, with the first 800,000 arriving in the UK in the coming days. I wonder how much of that is stock they have been building up while waiting for approval, and what the production capacity is.  It is still a good quick start to immunise frontline workers. Pfizer said they can produce 80m doses this year and up to 1.3B doses next year. They will have been producing these and other promising vaccine candidates in expectation of the green light for a fast rollout. Sorry, scalpers have already stockpiled all the vaccines using bots. If you want one now you have to buy them on Ebay or Marketplace. United airlines has already begun to fly and distribute the Pfizer vaccine at least to the US. Multiple 777s have been bringing over vaccines from Brussels to United\u2019s hub in Chicago since last Friday. Insane logistical hurdle to fly with dry ice to make it happen There's a great Freakonomics about vaccines. Well worth a listen. Countries have been pre ordering vaccines from multiple pharma's in the millions. They're basically funding a lot of the work and manufacturing. almost all of it, they started mass-producing it as soon as they had something ready for testing I think That is part of the reason this is available so fast. They had a positive initial sample, and immediately started production on that vaccine. If it didn\u2019t work, all they lose is money. Normally, production of a vaccine does not start until all the trials are complete. In the before times, we would normally just be   production now. Here\u2019s a very interesting article for anyone curious! Also I really hope these historic vaccine successes help humanity appreciate biomedical science and public health more. We\u2019ve been taking it for granted far too long. But really, this is a proud day for humanity. Dude we can\u2019t even appreciate the original threat... Don\u2019t bode well for us appreciating the prevention. I was just thinking how I\u2019m feeling an inexplicable sense of pride right now and I just realised it\u2019s basically what you said. Pride in humanity. This is an incredible achievement and one of those   moments. This article makes it sound as if Pfizer had the longterm strategy to develop Corona mRNA vaccines and asked Biontech to help them. In fact BionTech developed a strategy which is called light speed, contacted German and European Institutions very early on, had already the working vaccine developed in January, when most of the Western world didn't even took Corona seriously and only contacted Pfizer in March to help them with testing. Can't really be proud because for once we did the right thing even though it's probably for the wrong reasons. Yay, we were rational, awesome! /s Thanks for sharing. That was a great article. What are the expectations on global travel resuming over the next 12 months with vaccine rollout now starting at the end of 2020? Say, From Australia to the UK, for example? I imagine it will gated behind either being vaccinated and/or having a recent negative test until the world is satisfied with how many are immunised Wow. To get a vaccine out THIS fast, is honestly an incredible achievement in human history. And it\u2019s an absolutely   vaccine too! Now imagine what we could do if we put this much effort and resources into solving the climate emergency. Arguably the much bigger threat to our existence. Edit because this comment has gained a little traction: I think how fast we found a solution for Covid-19 shows what we can achieve. It makes me hopeful we can also solve the climate crisis. If I had seen this headline in April omg no way They had a head start from the last 2 SARS, still impressive. It's a fast beta test. Hijacking top comment to bring a guide to different vaccine types, since there\u2019s so much misinformation. This is from Nature (a top scientific academic journal): This is what it looks like when scientosts are given unlimited funding to develop something Fuck yeah! Fuck off, Covid Fuck covid. All my homies hate covid Fuck off, Covid In true British fashion, to the tune of Come On, Eileen. I bet we're going to be hearing this in crowds along with trumpets to those same three notes as \"come on England!\" Fuck you, Covid It\u2019s time to get out of The UK, Covid What were you even doing there in the first place, Covid? You didn\u2019t even get everyone infected, Covid Are you happy now, Covid? Fuck you, Covid. All the scientists, researchers, volunteers, and all the behind the scenes workers who have worked so hard to get this vaccine (and all the others) to this point deserve some kind of award. I\u2019d be surprised and simultaneously unsurprised if they don\u2019t win the Nobel in physiology and medicine at least Everyone's done their part. Thank you for this comment. Reddit gold? Clapping begins at 8 everyone! About time, I hope the Oxford one also turns out to be as effective, as it can be stored and transported safely in developing countries unlike the Pfizer one Just for comparison, going to throw in here that the flu vaccine is about 59% effective in adults 18-65. The Oxford one is 5% less effective and it is hoped it'll be approved by the end of the year. One point of clarification is that the Pfizer vaccine can likely also be transported at 5C as it is using the same delivery system. Pfizer simply didn\u2019t do a temperature study like Oxford so they can\u2019t officially claim that. About time? Never before was a medical application developed this quickly before. Usually it takes about 10 years and costs 2 billion dollars to get medicine on the market. One year is insanly fast! This is amazing. How is this not really big news on Reddit? Americans are asleep at the moment. American here, how big is this news in terms of football fields? On the east coast it is currently 6 am. Give it a couple of hours. People dont like the UK here, can guarantee a bad news story about the UK/Boris would be way more upvoted It is, you just have to give it a bit of time. American here. I just woke up and I am over the fucking moon. This news just instantly brightened my mood, I don't think it will be possible for me to have a bad today. I'm so proud of the virologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, biochemists and of the course the   who chose to put themselves out there for humanity. What a fucking achievement. This is such good news. They've built a centre in my city already that can vaccinate 100k people a week. The government has fucked up so much during this crisis, I really hope I can look back in a few months and say they stuck the landing Credit goes to the scientists and the career civil servants. In the rest of european union, we must wait for the official green light from the EU. Godspeed to UK though. The last words spoken before the zombie outbreak started. They had a great start with the far-more-left-wing-than-anyone-expected 80% furlough scheme. Looks like we're having a great end too, being the first country to approve a vaccine. Shame they fucked up basically everything in the middle. getting a vaccine is gonna be like trying to get an xbox series x or a ps5 lol Scalpers going to sell the vaccine on Facebook marketplace and eBay  /s Pretty much the opposite demographics though. The government have set out what order people will get it in, so if you're a young, healthy person, it's gonna be a while. But that's okay, it's far more important to protect the vulnerable and front line workers. Genuinely curious at how they\u2019re going to roll it out. Getting booked for a test was a nightmare to start and this will be in such a higher demand. Good news regardless! They're gonna be in stacks at the local Target like the consoles were on Saturday? Sweet, though they're gonna have to crank the AC in Target to like -70C I guess. Let\u2019s get this vaccine train rollin. I know it\u2019ll take some time to roll out, but I\u2019m hype. We\u2019re on our way back to normalcy boys! Hats off to everyone involved in making this vaccine happen in record time. I\u2019m curious to see how quickly/efficiently the U.K. will roll this out to the public. Hopefully we hear an approval from the U.S. and EU in the coming weeks/days. This is definitely a step in the right direction. The U.K. has really impressive logistics and I\u2019m sure they are going to get the army and basically everyone involved in the process, today they said they are going to create vaccination centres in the nightingales model and this will be alongside a community model in which the vaccine that does not need to be stored at -70c will be used in local gps! The relief our healthcare systems will get just by vaccinating our healthcare workers is good news. Right now they have to work under unbelievable stress. Know of two people (healthcare workers) confirmed to be getting it next week. The hospitals started planning at least a week earlier, hopefully more. Hopefully it's quick and much more successful than anything else the government has tried to do this year! EU decision is due on 29 Dec for the Pfizer vaccine and 12 Jan for the Moderna one. It was posted but not really upvoted, so posting it here to provide that information to people who hadn't seen it. I'm really worried about all the anti-vaxxers, they're all over youtube comment sections, news articles and facebook, full of conspiracy theories. Really hope it's not going to pose an issue and this is just a vocal minority. Well if it\u2019s anything like my flu vaccine at the weekend, pretty impressive. Everyone had to be masked and stay 2m apart. You were then given a 1 minute slot, which you had to be on time for with your arm out ready to go. There were two nurses vaccinating. I\u2019ve not seen it done like that ever here. Ramp the amount of people up doing the vaccinations, you could do a lot of people quite quickly. I believe the FT (who called this approval about a week ago) are saying the EU won't approve until end of the month. I am SO ready to go and stand awkwardly in bars again! I\u2019ll have this shot as soon as I can, I\u2019m not in a severe at risk group but am close to those who are. i have been immuno suppressed due to medication and that ends soon. the condition was respiratory and covid would definitely have finished me off 4 weeks ago. i can't wait for the opportunity to get this and the gp says i will be in the first tranche when it's available to her woot! Yeah if you're not an NHS worker or an old/vulnerable person, you're going to be waiting a long time. Not fussed when I get it, I just want my grandmother to get it so myself and family can visit her again Doesn't this vaccine only protect you from the affects, not make you not infectious? It's multiple shots Unless you're in a high priority group you're more likely to end up with the AstraZeneca Vaccine when it rolls around - its much cheaper and easier to distribute. It will be the more common vaccine once it's hit the market. Me too. When I went to get a vaccine booster the other day the pharmacist said probably March for us normal folk. And TBH I'm fine with that, it was way sooner than most of the doomsayers were saying we'd get one. Get it to people who need it most, first. I can keep waiting/taking precautions as long as I can get the vaccine sooner rather than later. How long does the vaccine last, does everyone have to get it every year? They're hoping for multiple years worth of immunity, but there's no way to be sure, considering it's been less than a year since they even started the vaccine. I think the idea might be that if enough people get it we achieve herd immunity, and maybe the virus will have nowhere to go, reducing the need for followup vaccines. This may be wrong tho, I'm no expert, so feel free to correct me. Finally, an end in sight The light of the tunnel is slowly but surely coming. For first world countries. My friend is a care worker in the UK, so excited for her to get it! My mum is, so I share this sentiment. Not to mention that she literally cannot afford to live if she has to take time off work if she gets the virus. In addition, she is not protected whatsoever from it as she works in a care home who do not take the virus seriously enough from the sounds of it. Yeah, I have several care worker family members, one of whom hasn't been able to work as she's also in a high risk group, so I'm very happy they'll be able to get it soon. As a care worker in the UK also, thank you for thinking of us \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m very happy for our friends in the UK! The end is finally coming into sight. Delivery and usage starts within a week! Great news to wake up to. I'd take this tomorrow if I could To the good people of the UK, I hope you guys get over this pandemic as fast as possible. I wish you all well and I hope you start seeing less numbers by febuary. Meanwhile I gotta enjoy that operation warp speed being slower than the UK lol. What a joke my country is right now. Glad to see kind messages from people instead of the usual Reddit hostility! I hope this works and I hope our Oxford vaccine works so we can share it with the world, including developing countries because it doesn't need to be frozen. We're set to approve it on the 12th I believe. For people who are worried that this vaccine was made \"too fast\": We are used to vaccine development taking decades because that's what we saw in our lifetimes. But the early vaccines were so easy that physicians in the 1800's who didn't really know what viruses were could develop a rudimentary vaccine within a few months of work. Vaccine research for existing diseases is only slow because the easy problems got solved centuries ago, we are stuck with the hardest nuts to crack. Covid is a brand-new virus, it could have been as easy as rabies or as hard as HIV, I think we simply got lucky. If it was more like SARS1, we might still be stuck on the animal research phase. Historically, infectious disease vaccines that reach Phase 3 trials have an 85% probability of success (source :  ) . It normally takes years for the trials to pass because volunteers generally get infected at a fixed rate. Covid was spreading so rapidly that this process was greatly accelerated. The trials were not rushed, the evidence of was just generated at an extremely fast pace. The trials were not rushed, the evidence of was just generated at an extremely fast pace. This isn't fully accurate. The trials were absolutely shortened. That's why they're applying for emergency authorization with the various regulatory bodies. I'm not saying it's a concern, just pointing out that the results from the trials are preliminary analysis. The trials are on-going and aren't completed. They'll continue to track those involved and record data. I'm absolutely not anti-vax, but the thing I don't get is how it is possible to study long term side effects of a drug that hasn't been through a long term trial. I don't doubt the effectiveness of the cure, I'm mostly concerned about the above. I also don't know how it's usually done, but I'm sceptical about there not having been taken any shortcuts at all. I remember a friend who works in medicine saying that usually the delay with most vaccine trials is bureaucratic paperwork. And since the covid vaccine is desperately needed, that paperwork was mostly eliminated so it could be fast-tracked. I get people concerned about the risk of long-term effects, but I'd rather take a very small gamble on unlikely long-term effects of this vaccine vs. well-documented and proven long-term effects of covid.  is shitting themselves Covid was a new world order ploy to get everyone to give up their rights to the government. Next comes microchips via vaccine. You'll get a card with your vaccine that you'll have to show to enter stores or travel. Soon you'll all be forced into labor camps to work for the new world order. I look forward to Scott Hall and Kevin Nash being our new leaders, but I'm not so sure about Hollywood Hulk Hogan. A jab   a National ID card, they must be going insane! Great news. I\u2019ve always been amazed by medical workers, people who spend each day helping others and seeing countless horrible and heartbreaking things, and this pandemic really has cemented in my mind just how brave and selfless these front-line workers are. I\u2019m very happy that soon they will be able to work without the fear of contracting COVID, and hopefully now be able to look forward to the end of this pandemic. How much of the population has to be vaccinated for it to kill off COVID? They\u2019re saying 70% should do it. Just out of curiosity because I\u2019m not entirely sure, is there a chance of long term side effects being undiscovered due to how quickly it\u2019s been produced? I\u2019m not entirely sure how the process works and wanted to know if it was something to worried or not. If not inject it into my vainssss Can't study long term effects of Corona either, but one seems better than the other Like a guy above said and i quote \"High effectiveness and since it's an mRNA vaccine it's much safer than traditional vaccines. You don't get the dangerous parts of the virus injected only the spike protein which is harmless. Also everything you get injected is gone after a few weeks so there is basically no risk of negative long-term effects.\" I'd also like to know this! I'm not against vaccines at all, I've just heard stories about vaccines in the past having long-term side affects and am worried it could be the same case here. Would appreciate any knowledge anyone has to share. I'm not completely on board because I still remember the Pandemrix vaccine. Gonna end up with a COVID vaccine before I get my RTX 3080. It'll be really interesting to see how Reddit reacts to this. The demographic tends to be a younger pro vaccine audience but at the same time anti UK due to its colonial past. Some big mixed responses coming I think. I've already seen other posts on this immediately bring up Scotland which is crazy and nothing to do with this but that's Reddit for you. It's an amazing achievement of the UK regulatory, scientific, and educational bodies. Honestly if you'd told me we'd have a vaccine by December I'd not have believed it. No one should fall for the loud minority either. The UK has a low number of anti vaxxers and is massively a progressive, science based culture that cares for the vulnerable. The priority list that has been released shows that the most vulnerable will get this vaccine first. I'm proud of my country and its achievements today despite many other areas for criticism that absolutely do exist. The UK is still world class in many areas and while I didn't vote Brexit and hate that we're leaving the EU I still have high hopes that Britain will continue to be an inclusive society where we welcome people from across the world. Those same people from all over the world that were involved in this vaccine, our Oxford vaccine, and our healthcare system. As someone from the UK I'm so happy. I think the govt knew how much we needed this which is how it's got done and dusted so early, because there are so many people not taking the rules seriously. I've already had Covid and had very light symptoms (as a young healthy person) but my father in his 80's will be getting this, he is still teaching piano at home and living mostly by himself so things have been very hard for him. And me making sure I don't give it to him. The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years This is such a huge achievement in Human History .. hopefully, everything goes well, and we get our normal life back soon What people need to realise when they see timeframe is that most vaccines take so long because of funding application and processing paperwork etc. Take me back to the motherland please \ud83d\ude28 It'll be interesting to see the widespread impact of this whether it speeds up approval elsewhere, or will countries wait and see it's effect on the Brits. The US will be approving this in December, the EU will approve it by Jan. Absolutely incredible achievement. Just out of interest, what happens to the mRNA in the cells? Does it simply breakdown when the cell is destroyed by the immune system or can it replicate itself? It's broken down shortly after it's translated, mRNA is not a very stable molecule. Wooo the beginning of the end Science saves our ungrateful asses. Again. I will not be getting this vaccine until it's been out and used for a while... Largely because I'm not in the age range or occupation to get it. In fact those are the only reasons. Beware the fucking idiot conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers in the comments. This is a great win for all of humanity and we made history. Some people have been watching way to much TV... Kudos to the UK for authorizing it this quickly. Boy am I   looking forward to anti-vaxxer nitwits shitting things up everywhere, though. And I'm sitting here watching AWS Re:invent 2020 videos and, presuming he's being accurate, the guy speaking now says Moderna, another vaccine manufacturer, used machine learning and rapid expansion of compute resources. I welcome anti-vaxxer nitwits. One less person in the queue for a vaccine and sane people can get on with business in semi-normality. I hope my mom can get it when it comes to the US. :( My 2 shares I bought of Pfizer and moderna should be making me a millionaire any day now \ud83d\ude02 So my company just announced they will begin giving vaccines to front line workers first. I work for a major hospital corporation. I agree with this, that ER and intensive care units get them first, however I work in xray and we are ALL over the hospital, including the ER. We are as much front line as the er and icu in the sense that we are always in there doing xrays. However we are not included in the first rounds, and have to wait til everyone else gets them. It's typical though, xray always gets the last of things.. Whoa, that\u2019s pretty crazy news. Awesome! Who knows if the public is willing to take the vaccine. There are so many conspiracies spreading and anti-vaccinations are at its high. Good luck UK! Alfie from Wolverhampton with a btec in PE - \u201cNah it ain\u2019t possible m8, never takin that vaccine m8.\u201d I'm looking forward to the 28 days after the start of the vaccination Proud moment to be British, the NHS workers desperately deserve this. Also sounds like they'll be receiving it along with the elderly as early as possible. Yep elderly and care home workers first then NHS workers Great news, I am ready to become Blinky and see the world again. People, as good as this is, remember that actual mass roll out will take months, because of production and distribution bottlenecks! Stay safe!! I have so many questions but since this post has been up for a while I doubt anyone will see it. Why are two shots a month apart required? How much of an impact will this be if people only get the first shot? I know that they said they could have 1.3 billion vaccines produced by the end of next year so worldwide ~650 million will be vaccinated. I know that other companies are producing vaccines so that number will definitely go up but how long will it take for there to be a noticeable impact? I worry is that people will see that the vaccine is going to be rolling out soon and let their guard down. My biggest concern is how the hospitals will hold up over the next couple of months with winter kicking in. I\u2019m not trying to be a downer or take away from the hope this brings. I just hope people understand that they still need to take covid seriously for now while they celebrate this great news. 1: to build both short & long-term immune cells, according to the Biontech  CEO. Lots of ordinary vaccinations require booster shots too, after all. It's not unusual. 2:  They'll likely only build short-term immunity, the kind that fades in 90-120 days. When Biontech publishes the data soon, there'll likely be more in-depth info on this. 3: The CEO estimates 9-12 months before we can abandon our masks.  Happy vaccine day everyone! can't any nation produce their own vaccine now by just copying the formula of phizer? well, whatever happened to that Astrazeneca-oxford vaccine? I hope they dont stop with that, rest of the developing world is kind of counting on that vaccine. I feel like this is going to create an economic vaccine class system, where rich countries get the pfizer/moderna vaccine and everyone else gets the azn-oxford vaccine We\u2019re in the endgame now. Lots of bots in here Do u know because u are one? I am by no means anti-vax, and have had many vaccines in my life, but isn't it kinda spooky taking a vaccine that hasn't been tested for very long at all, relative to every other vaccine? Generally the rapid development has been due to: existing technologies to build on. understanding other coronavirus mechanism of action. Basically running phase I, II and III concurrently. As opposed to 2 years of each, sequentially. Low financial risk of advancing through trials due to extreme demand. Isn't a new flu vaccine developed every year? People seem fine taking that. What's the difference? Good on ya. Imagine if this constitutes a return to normalcy, God I never imagined I would be missing 2019 why wouldnt it We haven't burned down nearly enough 5G towers. We've really taken our eye off the ball. Unfortunately in the US, when the vaccine becomes readily available we can expect up to half the country to not get the vaccine based on their conspiracies. Might be a stupid question but has it been proven this is safe long term? Feels awfully rushed It feels rushed because researchers usually have to wait for funding, approval etc. which is  what takes up the time. In this case, funding was almost immediately available and everyone placed the research as highest priority. It\u2019s the bureaucracy and begging for funding that\u2019s been rushed, not the testing and trialling. This vaccine is dramatically different to any vaccine in the past, because it\u2019s been the top of every single priority list since February. Even down to the recruiters finding junior level chemical engineers to work in the manufacturing plants (I interviewed for some of those roles - the whole process from getting a call from a recruiter to feedback from the interview saying I didn\u2019t get the job was under two weeks) If it\u2019s approved, it\u2019s approved. Every person that\u2019s involved with approving this is very well aware of those concerns, and know it\u2019s many thousands of lives on the line if they get it wrong. As they\u2019re the scientists, I\u2019ll trust them to know more about it than me Not trying to be pessimistic and am the furthest thing from an anti vaxxer, but I\u2019m holding off for a couple of months. The quickest vaccine in human history, with limited tests as well as any long term effects that may not be known yet. I\u2019d rather stay socially distanced and keep a mask on for a few more months, then get the shot. Most countries will be rolling out the vaccine to frontline medical workers and the elderly in the 1st instance. Unless you are in those groups you will probably have to wait a few months regardless. Unless you're in one of the risk groups you won't be asked to have one probably until next summer anyway. Replace months with years. You need a herd immunity. The only way to get it is vaccinate the herd. Someone has to GP, thank you UK! I am so happy. The end is in sight. Britain has pre-ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, which was 95% effective in a late stage clinical trial. THANK FUCKING GOD Cries in American America will have it within a few weeks. They can\u2019t afford not to. Fascinating.  I\u2019m not sure how it is in the UK within the United States there seems to be this perception that as soon as anybody starts getting the vaccine everything\u2018s going to go back to \u201cnormal\u201c. People don\u2019t seem to understand that even as average people in the population have access to the vaccine masks, social distancing and closed businesses are still going to be there. The UK does have the advantage of a national social health system, that can be geared up for nationwide inoculation (which it is in the process of doing). The health market in the US is so fractured, and there's no central command system that can be used in emergencies. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic, but how good will this actually be long term? From what I\u2019ve heard getting the virus only gives you immunity for a few months at best, so I\u2019m assuming it will be the same for a vaccine? If so do we just have to keep constantly taking this every few months forever? I know it\u2019s kind of similar with the flu vaccine but that\u2019s seasonal, and so far COVID hasn\u2019t showed any signs of being worse at different times of the year. Sorry if this sounds stupid it just seems like even with a vaccine things can\u2019t go back to normal The idea is, that with enough people having immunity across the population that it can get down it\u2019ll effectively become no longer in wide circulation and to the eventual goal of eradication (yay!). Also with a vaccine you usually get a booster jab that extends the immunity so your white blood cells can store the \u2018code\u2019 to respond to another infection in future :) From what I\u2019ve heard getting the virus only gives you immunity for a few months at best, so I\u2019m assuming it will be the same for a vaccine? I think that is not clear. As far as I heard, it is not fully understood why the immunity might not last that long, and it is very well possible that this class 2 vaccine can circumvent the reasons for that. The body is told in a completly different way to form antibodies, so it is very well possible that it works longterm. Big pharma would never lie for money  if the vaccine will be available in a specific country / region.. will it be mandatory for everyone or will it be free to choose if you want to do it or not (i guess most people want to)? or will it maybe even depend on your job / work you do? how will this be done? i never thought about this whole thing in detail but now i'm curious how this will be likely be done. edit: i'm not anti-vax, just curious about how it will be rolled out likely. I don't think it will be mandatory in most democratic countries. I can imagine it being mandatory for certain occupations such as healthcare. So, I can\u2019t answer for everywhere, but in my country you cannot be forced to take the vaccine. If you are a hospital worker, maybe. IIRC I did however hear that since some of the vaccines have a 95% efficiency you only need like 3/4 of the population to vaccinate to reach herd immunity - a lot of older adults are very skeptical after the whole swine flu vaccine thing, where some of the recipients developed things like epilepsy. I didn't think i'd get so emotional at the news, my nan has COPD and more than anything im so happy for her, she will finally get some normalcy back after an horrific year. Well done to the scientists and those volunteers willing to put their bodies on the line for testing. I know we're running out of time, with the global economy collapsing due to covid and corners are inevitably going to be cut, but I really hope this vaccine has no adverse effects. That being said, I'll still get it as soon as I can. It appears that the only adverse effects are things like headaches, fever, general aches, and fatigue that last around 2 days. Outside of that, there has been little report of anything extraordinarily bad. That being said, I\u2019d take that 3 times over instead of COVID. give me all of the vaccines right now This is great! Hopefully the US follows suit. Also, I'm assuming this means Pfizer and BioNTech stock will be rising come morning? Time to finish my vaccination course, business is boomin This day is history. Vaccination will take a while, I see that they'll likely only get the vaccine rolled out to everyone by end of spring / early summer, optimistically. What are the risks of someone who is vaccinated acting like they are totally immune? Can they still spread it? Increased chance of mutations? This is the light at the end of the tunnel. Talk is cheap but when approvals are done, it's a bit of a relief after months of never knowing. WOOHOO!!!! fuck yessss Humans ... We get shit done ! I hope enough have been rolled out and used before christmas, not for me though (I'm happy to have an excuse not to leave my house) but for the morons who are stupid enough to travel without a vaccine but not quite stupid enough to be anti vax Let's goooo bois!!! i can't wait to get back into theaters and concerts I sat in a lecture with the chief pharmacist of the Sussex NHS trust, they believe they will have vulnerable groups vaccinated by March, which is excellent news. Fuck yeah !! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f I'm so proud of that happening this fast in the UK! This vaccine hopefully will help on reducing the virus greatly over there! stick it in me So I am uneducated on this subject. Why is the UK getting the vaccine first as opposed to the US or other European countries? FDA is setting for emergency review I believe on the 7th of December. If approved then roll out to USA This should be top of front page. Do people only upvote bad news? Did they said who will be vaccinated first?some news say frontline workers, others high risk groups care home residents and their carers are first on the list Great news! Lets just hope there's nothing in the near future which may slow down imports or cause issues at our ports... ...oh shit. BRB moving to uk Trump will blow a fuse, because \"he\" is not 1st to confirm. Saved by the Germans. Remind me in 28 days..... In all seriousness though this is awesome Faster.

Another HDMI is connected to my Xbox One X currently into the receiver. If I get a new 4K UHD TV, would I need a new HDMI 2.1/4K male-to-female extender thru the wall?

First off, if this is not the right place to put this question, just let me know. My actual question: Reddit keeps showing me advertisements for porn. I do not do porn, nor do I ever intend to. How do I make it stop showing me these ads? I tried reporting the ones by Google as inappropriate, but that doesn't do anything, and not all of them are by Google. Go to your browser settings and look for suspicious add-ons and extensions. Reddit doesn't show advertisements for porn, but a dodgy add-on will stuff ads into legitimate sites. Then download ublock origin, the best ad-remover. Does a website exist that categorizes the icons for apps in the App Store? Why do I want this? I saw an app icon that I couldn\u2019t see the name for but I don\u2019t want to ask the person about it so is there a way I can search for color/objects in the icon and find it that way? I recently bought two new Samsung TVs to put in the same room. They are working great...except when I use the remote to control one...it also controls the other. Is there a way that I can change the frequency, or buy one remote that will allow me to switch between sets? Hello everyone! Can I root my Android phone without a computer? ( I need uninstall apps that come with the phone - if u know any other form, please tell me!) Does rooting leave my phone vulnerable? Is there a way of \"unrooting\", so that it become secure? Which tech companies do you reckon produce the best displays in phones, tablets and computers these days? Sony Vaio VGN-NW240F Laptop: When purchased it was running WIN 7 and I installed WIN 8.1 to practice installing an OS. Regardless, could it run WIN 10 if I switch out just the hard drive to a bigger sized one? Or should I switched out some of the internal hardware as well including the hard drive in order for it to run Win10 efficiently? Or just get a new laptop? Thanks in advanced! India technology is good and no.1 :-  Can someone explain very plainly what installing and maintaining servers is, as a job? Can it be time consuming and with odd hours? ICT that is not electronic and digital -> Hello, so well I got this question for school and I just cannot find any answers for it. The teacher asked: ,,What are some examples (tools, resources..) that are ICT ( Informtion and Communications Technology) but are not electronic and digital?\" Could anyone help me with this one? I would be hella thankful Smoke signals, abacus, newspapers, books, the good ole' pencil and paper. Magnifying glasses. In fiber communication, many line splices are physical instead of traditional routers. A trumpet. Welding. A few of  . Anyone know a comfortable pair wireless headphones that will last a while? I was thinking of buying AirPods Pro before, but I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019ll probably only last 2 years. My television set, which is connected to YouTube, drops the Wi-Fi connection when I am watching 4K videos. Does anyone know why this happens? Some samsung TVs offer \"crystal 4k\" and say 4k upscaling versus some that say 4k. Are both of these full 4K?

{"'Tis The Season: Congress Looks To Sneak In Unconstitutional Copyright Reform Bill Into 'Must Pass' Spending Bill": ["It involves the executive branch trying to route around the courts to set up a judicial body to handle disputes about private rights Copyright that can (will) be used to censor internet content. This is like mandatory arbitration in contracts. Bingo. They get this out of the courts, make you arbitrate with your fucking HOA when you have a property dispute, force immigrants into a second class court, shit I bought a new car last year and toyota attempted to have me sign an arbitration agreement for the purchase. It's out of control. Not a real democracy. Except it's not mandatory, which is probably why it isn't unconstitutional. Also it looks like this passed the House in 2019, so I'm not sure how it ended up tied to a Spending Bill in 2020. Not unless copyright holders start dropping like flies. 'cause if we want the world to continue, copyright holders and enforcers are going to have to drop like flies unless the bill is wiped from existence. Tax, EPA, domain names, ICE, Military courts... The CASE act would allow either party to opt out within 60 days, it isn't mandatory. And really the underlying issue is that litigating copyright claims are prohibitively expensive. It can cost well over $100k in attorneys fees for a case that goes to trial. Even at a basic level, ignoring the attorneys fees it is cost prohibitive for many. If someone infringes on your work, you send a DMCA, they file a couterclaim, usually the host will publish the work again until you show you have filed a lawsuit. To do that you need to get confirmation of copyright registration before you can start a lawsuit for infringement. This costs as little as $45, but then it takes 6-8 months to get your registration back. Or for $800 you can expedite the request and get it back within a week. Then the filing fees for federal court are around $400, plus $50-$100 to serve the defendant. Only then could you have the infringing content removed. Defacto, unless you are very wealthy you do no have access to the court system, those that do can already censor you. The CASE act allows for claims without registration (and paying this fee to expedite), lowering your upfront cost, and allowing you to take action against an infringer without a 6+ month wait. The discovery process is simplified, greatly lowering attorneys fees. Wait, Senate is part of the Legislative branch Someone needs to setup a YouTube alternative that works like torrents. Decentralized and controlled by no one. So giving corporations all the power. Oh boy... how bad is it? Democrats just won the election and are looking to finish the control on the masses by controlling what is seen on the internet. But they are for the people so it must be okay. destruction of section 230 of the DMCA will fuck us all In order to use this court to sue, the claimant must have properly filed a copyright with the copyright board, and had that claim accepted. If you don't prove that you hold the copyright to the work in question then you do not get to use this court system. The only copyright bill I want to see passed limits all copyright to 40 years.  Patents are only valid for 20 years so why the hell is copyright basically forever. Disney didn't want other people to make money off public domain like they've been doing for decades so paid a bunch senators lots of money. lol in your   copyrights still last half of a long lifetime. Read Free Culture. tldr: Return copyright to an opt-in, rather than copyrighting everything automatically for around a century. MY fantasy: 1st year from the creation of a work: normal copyright rules we have now (automatic copyright registration) Every year after: geometrically increasing cost to register. Ex., $15, then $30, then $100, then $500, then $1000, and so on. Most art makes or doesn't make its money within a few years of release. Most art is just a waste of its government-granted copyright monopoly 10, 20, 50, 100 years after release. If we're talking about Steamboat Willie (1928), if you assume that it shouldn't just be public domain, the cost should reflect the cost to the public not being able to remix it freely. On the order of $10,000,000+ per work per year. The net effect will be 99+% of copyrighted works will go to the public domain, where they belong, and it will finally become commercially viable to re-issue and preserve them. Disney can have Mickey Mouse. There's some cultural loss, but people focus on the mouse and lose sight of all the works we're actively losing. MM is under lock and key in Disney archives. Other art is literally withering away. Greatly limit the cases where copyright is implicated. As Free Culture explains, a book has limited copyright implications, but an ebook has copyright implications every step of the way - downloading, copying, reading, sharing with a friend, re-selling. Greatly expand fair use, remix, sharing, decryption/hacking/jailbreaking, and first sale rights. Look at Creative Commons for inspiration. Patents expire to prevent monopolizing. Imagine if only one person or company could make telephones for example? Obviously not good. \u201cPatents are meant to give the inventor an advantage, not a monopoly.\u201d (I forget where I read that quote but I feel like it summarizes my point pretty well.) Copyright doesn\u2019t expire because there\u2019s not really anything to monopolize. If Disney is still using Mickey Mouse, other people shouldn\u2019t be able to just take their characters. What are they monopolizing? The Mickey Mouse industry? That\u2019s just my take on it at least. Death plus 10 years is a good standard. Because Disney doesn\u2019t mine losing patents as much as intellectual property. 40 years is still a stretch, but then again, so is one minute. The ownership of ideas is a disgusting enterprise tied to capitalism's deep problems and core failings as a system and concept and nothing else, it's a shitty bandaid for an even shittier problem. All ideas belong to all people. No person exists alone, no idea comes from a vacuum, everything from sharpening a rock to mickey mouse to Michael Jackson's Thriller to assembling a nuclear reactor are the rightful intellectual property of all human beings. The sharing of ideas is the only thing that makes us miserable apes even notable as a species in our history books. Woah, woah. Patents and copyrights are about as similar as mail postage and phonesex hotlines. \"Okay, I can make a generic version of viagra now\" and \"Mickey Mouse is mine now too\" are NOT comparable in the way you claim. How can we stop it? The American people actually nut-up and start asking these people these questions every fucking single second these whores masquerading as politicians leave their houses. Give them absolutely ZERO PEACE outside of their own homes. Hold these fuckers accountable for...hell, fucking ANYTHING. Actually threaten our leaders like people did in the past By making your legislators fear the electorate again. Because our attention is being focused on whether or not we can go outside and do things because of COVID. They\u2019re intentionally dividing our attention and making us fight over stupid things while they sit here and do this. Can't. Whole system is permanently fucked. Trump has been a nightmare for sure, but the complete lack of care by the american people along with the ignorant hate that has permeated and divided every group in this nation has made it pretty fucking easy for these devil's to take more and more control. Rip. Shit is still better than alot of third world countries though. So count your blessings while you still can Vote in primaries, contact your reps, be a millionaire donator Well when France tried to pass a law they didn't like, they started rioting and burning down banks. France has shelved the law. Why is this even possible? I don't live in the US, and I'm confused as to why this kind of stuff is even constitutional and possible to begin with? It really shouldn\u2019t be legal but many Americans have learned that the best parts of our government are tradition not legality. All it takes is a few assholes to ruin everything. First, there is no rule that a bill has to be constitutional to be passed by Congress and Executive Branch (President).  A bill has to be challenged up through the Judicial (Supreme Court) to get ruled unconstitutional.  Thus the US \"three co-equal branches of government\" that make bills reality. Second, there is also nothing that requires a bill to be all about a single topic so what happens is bullshit like this copyright reform gets added to critical funding bills that have to pass to keep money flowing to government agencies/processes.  This is why from time to time we have government shut downs where some add on to critical spending bills is atrocious enough to one of the branches that they opt to take their toys and go home which results in funding stopping and government shutting down. Another interesting note is that our constitution is the oldest existing constitution of modern democracies and definitely shows its age when it comes to things like this.  If you look at some other democracies there are triggers where the politicians basically all get fired and new elections are held if they deadlock on passing critical bills to keep the government functioning. Well this article is saying it's likely not constitutional, but that doesn't come into play until congress passes it and then someone brings a lawsuit challenging constitutionality. The founding documents of our Constitution were fraught with compromises in order to get all the states on board to begin with, and rely a great deal on the people in office to simply   do things that would break how the process is supposed to work. It's also being done by the people who would have to write and pass the laws that would stop them from doing it, so you can see how that's an issue. 95% of what the US federal government does is unconstitutional if you don't do some twisted mental gymnastic interpretation and read the constitution as it is written. Simple. The legislative branch is allowed to pass essentially whatever they like. If they passed a bill banning the press, it'd be struck down by the courts quickly, but they are still allowed to pass it. Congress loves inflammatory headlines that distract the public from things like this so they can do their business in the dark. Laws only mean anything if they\u2019re enforced. There is so much corruption in our government, due to a variety of weaknesses in our system that were continuously exploited and widened instead of being addressed, that things like \u2018constitutionality\u2019 are often just ignored, and if they get to the Supreme Court, it\u2019s at best a crapshoot whether the judgement will be reasonable or just say that something clearly unconstitutional is ok due to some sort of loophole of conveniently twisted reading of the constitution. Do you mean the CASE act? Generally speaking, small claims courts with less costly discovery and other limited rules are constitutional because either party could opt out. Both parties can get a fair outcome, but at a reduced cost and usually faster. With including random things into the expenditure bill, usually only uncontroversial items make up the bulk of it, but this is one of the processes used to pass Also Trump does tons of stuff \u201cbecause he is president\u201d and no one person technically outranks him. People who should enforce the will of people (Senate) don\u2019t and instead enable him because he represents their party and their wishes. That\u2019s why when they suddenly usher in a new supreme court justice in an election year, they got away with it. With previous presidents they have respectfully given the next president the choice because it\u2019s not appropriate to do it right away. Literally, they pushed for Obama to not name new Supreme Court justice because there was an election coming up in a few months. This one Trump ushered in was considered unqualified and was done during an election. Trump just wants to back the courts with Republicans to keep his agenda as much as he can. Yay, fuck a stimulus, let\u2019s make big telecom happy. Big telecom? No, this is a bill to make the RIAA happy. Look at who's lobbying for this. Didn\u2019t Trump also try and threaten to veto the bill unless they also repeal Section 230, the very bill that keeps free speech on the internet alive So who in Congress introduced the bill? Jeffries, a democrat from NY, introduced this whole bullshit idea under the (extremely false) pretense that it could protect photographers and semi-amateur creators / painters by allowing them to protect themselves in obvious cases of infringement when currently it would be too expensive to press the legal claim. In  , when not abused, this idea has lots of merit. He knew   what he was doing though as did the people who've been pushing this since. Someone needs to ram through a bill that states that all laws that are only approved as part of another non-related bill are no longer enforceable. It's in 43 state constitutions. Look up single-subject rule. A single-subject rule amendment to the US constitution is something that has been proposed as early as 1999. Maybe tie it to a stimulus /s Not going to happen.  Both parties do this. What does keeping the government running have to with completely overhauling the copyright system to enable massive copyright trolling? Disney's, MPAA's and RIAA's pocketbooks. If only Disney tried to write an original thought for once. Why doesn\u2019t anyone overhaul copyright law to prevent abuse? The government isn\u2019t even getting anything from it. Its already hard to stream video game content that has in game music, because even though its part of the game its not your music to stream. I was literally irritated about this exact thing yesterday! I wanted to find a steamers playthrough of a game, but they had to delete all of it because of the fkn music   ... It's crazy. This exact issue happened literally yesterday with the fortnite event thing. My friend had to delete their entire vod and all clips from the stream because Epic Games used copyrighted music in the event. Not just music. The games themselves are copyrighted just the same. Unless you have a license to stream them you can get dmca'd. The problem is most folks don't understand that it is up to the GAME COMPANIES to get the right license to use the music in their games so that it can be streamed without issue. If the game companies do that, then there will be no legit DMCA takedown for the clip. For games that get the proper licenses this isn't an issue. oh christmas tree (bill) oh christmas tree (bill), unbalanced are your amendments This is another massive reason our politics are designed to pit us against each other. All of this constant, \"well you voted against XYZ\" when XYZ was included with ABC which has nothing to do with anything else....and more then likely would never even be considered on it's own merit. It really is a joke, and the fact that people are so dogmatic with their politics, really goes to show just how well theyve refined their methods to keep everyone at each others throats.  Wake up people.  Wake up. And before the BS starts, this is not a party specific issue, this is constant within our politics from all angles.  This Is merely an example. This is a party issue though. Dems passed a bill back in the summer that McConnells senate has not taken up. He took the Senate on recess before he even entertained negotiations that weren't needed because the house passed a bill. He and republicans in the Senate are not doing their jobs. They are prioritizing this shit and protection for business over relief and aid for we the people. Our government is far from perfect and Dems have their faults for sure, but when one branch, controlled by one party, fails to do their job on purpose, it absolutely is a specific party problem. It's a Republican-led Senate trying to make changes to the Democratic-led House bill to include this shit, and it would have to be approved by GOP-led White House. Democrats have literally no role in fucking up this bill and there's little they can do to stop the changes, as again anyone with power to make these changes are Republicans. Yet somehow BoTh SiDeS aRe ThE SaMe It comes back to the fact that they don\u2019t represent people, or sometimes even their own opinions.  They represent a party, and will spend all of their time ensuring that the other side doesn\u2019t get anything notable done.  Hence why a two party system(imo) sucks It really isn't a bothsides issue though. This election should've made that abundantly clear to everyone. Nah, one side is fucking shit up a lot more. It's the fucking Republicans plain and simple.  Corporate Dems are corrupt as well, but nowhere near the level of the Republican Party as a whole.  Just look at the bills that the Democratic controlled House has passed, that the vast majority of people want some form of, in which the GOP controlled Senate refuses to even bring to a vote, let alone committee markups. Absolutely correct Actually, the usual reason people are pitted against another is because one side or both sides completely lack critical thinking skills. This is evident with your comment. You did not read the same bill I read. You went off a very short article with outdated information in it, and ran with it. You did not, for one second, question the article you read. People could not be pitted against one another if they are taught to properly evaluate information, and think critically of information they are presented with. And now, because of this error you made, you have added gas to the fire and have worked people up over things that are not true. And this shit happens every day on social media about all manner of shit, and people need to stop. Just stop being an unwitting agent of chaos and misinformation. Did you know our first past the Post electoral system is mathematically flawed and will always result in a stagnant two party system? It\u2019s capitalism, it\u2019s the utter lack of class consciousness. Yup, empire collapsing due to corruption. Holy shit, no one is actually comprehending your comment. \"Congress\" is mentioned as a whole body is attempting to pass this bill... when in reality we are very much aware that it is a specific segment of Congress attempting to pass this bill... I don't know if unconstitutional is the right word for this case, but certainly not something we want passed as is... nor do we want it tied to the spending bill. I mean if you read the article you\u2019d have seen that the bill has bipartisan support. you know the CASE act was introduced by a Democrat, right? I bet when you wrote this comment you didn't anticipate that the Democrats are that specific segment of Congress Why it may be unconstitutional: Article III vests the judicial power of the United States in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. Consequently, Congress cannot confer the Government\u2019s judicial Power on entities outside Article III. See Greene v. Oil States Energy, decided by a non-partisan majority. Same arguments failed to take down the PTAB. Congress can if it's a voluntary court though. Man, I am so tired of Congress being able to slip in amendments to a bill that has absolutely zero to do with the bill. Just so the bill will die in the vote. Wish there were more members of congress willing to make a rule about how bills should only deal with the subject they\u2019re about and not allow amendments that have nothing to do with the bill. FFS...we need to rescind omnibus bills, and go back to individual bill voting. Too many items slip through the sieve of omnibus riders. This BS tactic of tacking on tons of unrelated things into one huge bill needs to be outlawed. Why the fuck does this process resemble date rape? Mmmm gotta love that Christmas pork. Oh look at that. Another bipartisan effort to fuck over the people for special interest groups. Hot damn it's almost like republicans and Democrats are the same people. But we'll just keep voting for them and letting shit like this keep happening. Thing is it likely it does not have bipartisan support to be put into another bill by the backdoor. How many Democrats are pushing to put this into the government appropriations bill? Why must they try to control every facet of our lives? It's complicated.  But in the end, it is a good thing for people to have copyrights, but where we draw the line is hard.   Like why should I bother inventing a new idea if let's say disney is just gonna copy it, and run me out of business.  It decentivises me from making new intiatives, the last thing you want to do is stop ppl like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos from taking initiative and making more things that are beneficial for society.    On the other hand, it hurts small business too, when those giants can just buy up all the copyrights and prevent others from doing it (China is notorious for doing this, hence why China copyrighted the \"Trump Toilet\" then ransomed it too Trump). Law student here. This nation\u2019s copyright laws are pretty hot garbage. I\u2019m almost always in favor of any kind of reform that acknowledges computers in meaningful way.  Y\u2019know, something to distinguish between personal use and business use, or maybe something that formalizes or gives end users some right to share altered content, like video gameplay. Current law doesn\u2019t give you the right to share your gameplay (which was not decided by Congress, bur rather courts in caselaw. So Congress could fix it.) Since this doesn\u2019t seem to be it, the search continues... I am legitimately so fucking done and pissed with copyright all together whether it's the EU's Article 23 reform or the US passing stupid laws to further tighten copyright. To the point were i legitimately pirate everything out of spite for it and to not get abused by either DRM or Terms Of Services. What is the fucking point of Congress? They might as well just do whatever they want. Its clear your people dont matter anymore. Tho it not the whole of Congress. Such and Such Industry purchases congressional favor by spending   amount of money on lobbying Congress adds unconstitutional rider to essential funding bill as a thank you for that sweet, sweet lobbying money Unconstitutional provisions are taken to court to overturn at great expense, costing the challenging citizens and taxpayers an amount of money at least a hundred times more than  .   This money is vacuumed right out of the pockets of John Q Taxpayer, hammering mainly the middle and lower class with yet another needless government expense Industry that caused it sees no repercussions, and actually benefits financially more than they lobbied, because the law was changed; even if it was briefly on a temporary basis they'll likely still come out ahead in the end Rinse and repeat \u221e times Fun fact, there are a total of maybe 60 sound recordings in existence that are in the public domain, and all of them have been in the public domain since their publication (due to being produced by the US military or otherwise exempted from copyright protection). And you can tuck this little factoid in your pocket for the foreseeable future, as not a single sound recording will lapse into the public domain until 2063. We are being scammed out of our cultural birthright by Disney, the big three record labels, and their lobbyists. How about you sneak in some FUCKING STIMULUS It's funny how these assholes are always passing or trying to pass shit like this that always end up fucking us the people. We need to invest in guillotines..... I just don\u2019t understand how completely unrelated issues can be put on the same bill and voted on together? I\u2019m not American and my political knowledge isn\u2019t extensive but this just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. This is no surprise, but frankly I'm convinced every copyright law after the Copyright Act of 1909 has been completely unconstitutional since they stifle creation of new works. And by \u201cCongress\u201d we of course mean \u201cRepublicans\u201d I've read the bill and I don't find any of the concerns presented to be valid. For starters, BOTH parties have to consent to this court's jurisdiction, and a default judgement is only possible if someone has properly served the other party with the notice and complaint -- and served in the way any other lawsuit would be served. There are large fines applicable to copyright trolls. There is review in the Federal court if there are any shenanigans, and the bad faith actor will have to pay the other's legal expenses. There are two levels of review present in this forum. You can appeal, and if you're denied the right to have your appeal heard, you can appeal that denial as well to a higher level. Read the bill yourselves. I find this techdirt article to be completely misrepresenting how this bill functions. The techdirt article mentions that this sounds like a court under executive power that routes around the judicial branch, which may be unconstitutional, which would be a valid concern, however I'm no lawyer so I'll leave that to professionals. Generally any time the government starts passing copyright legislation it's almost universally awful. Don't consent? You don't get modern media. Do you seriously hear yourself? Most people don't read EULAS or copyright licenses. Compare to Greene v. Oil States Energy, it's basically the same issue but for patent law and a non-partisan majority upheld the PTAB. How bout we stop letting them do this shit? The drivers of these trucks aren't useful assets. The business about it being unconstitutional sounds a lot like the arguments against the PTAB in Greene v. Oil States Energy, and that was a non-partisan majority. I think the Court would allow it (even though I personally disagree with it). Then in 2 years or so when these politicians are up for reelection, their opponents can come out and say \"see my opponent votes for this terrible copyright law\" if they vote for this spending, or \"see my opponent doesn't care about working family's because he voted against the spending bill\" if they vote against it. In these type of situations it's a lose-lose proposition and relies on educated voters to distinguish between letting something bad pass to get something much more important through. But most voters aren't educated and don't follow the news or remember what happened 2 years ago and that's why we are in the mess we are in today. I fucking hate riders. They're blackmail. Here's an idea, if there's anything in the bill other than giving the American people a NSA cash payment, the bill goes directly into the trash. This continues until these lame brain mouth breathing old bitches can finally learn to follow instructions. Apparently none of them never attended 1st grade. How about someone sneak in a bill that says you can't sneak bills in anymore Welcome to the Untied Corporations of America I\u2019m sorry but what\u2019s so bad about this Bill? I looked into it and it really just looks like it\u2019s establishing a small claims board that only exists if both parties agree to have a case heard by it. All it does is establish a \u201ccopyright court\u201d that exists to settle disputes on copyright infringement. The payout is capped at $30,000 so that people won\u2019t get completely destroyed by fees and all court costs have to be paid by the individuals. This actually sounds like it could be a really good thing for small creators to pursue cases of copyright infringement, but since the defendant can opt out and does not actually HAVE to participate I don\u2019t see what\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional\u201d about it The payout is capped at $30,000 so that people won\u2019t get completely destroyed by fees and all court costs have to be paid by the individuals. So i can steal your idea and all i have to pay you is 30k.. Fk you i'm in. Also please share your idea with me.. I will not steal them. Why don\u2019t they just make a law having it be illegal to slip random bs things into a Bill? Why don't they pass laws that reduce their options for corruption? Easy, they want to be able to pay their owners. Dude fuck the rule that allows multiple things to be included in a single bill. Stop this practice of shoving in a little extra foot note on a bill that has nothing to do with the rest of the bill. Copyright has nothing to do with covid relief. The bill should have a \"subject\" and things that fall outside of the subject should get their own bill. How anyone voted for this evil, evil man... blows my mind.  He's not stupid, he's smart ... greedy... and evil. I gotta say, it\u2019s really stupid that American lawmakers get to just put whatever the hell legislation they want on a totally unrelated bill. If an idea needs to be snuck into another bill it\u2019s probably not worth having. \"Must pass\" is how they get all of the shady shit into the bills. Congress is supposed to fund the government with a dozen spending bills throughout the year. The omnibus and the debt ceiling are self imposed so when they come up for a vote and a congressperson goes, \"Hey! I don't agree with the handout to X or the abortion language in the SPENDING bill\" and votes NO the \"news\" will have endless interviews from other members talking about how member X wants to shut down the government, and right before Christmas. \u201cCongress\u201d? Who exactly? Which members and for whom? Who does this law benefit and why is it being included considered? Why is there no discussion around it? These articles leave you angry without really informing you. America is such a shit hole country I don't think there's any malintent here, I think there's laziness. Congress knows full well that the act is flawed Constitutionally. They simply want SCOTUS to sort it out for them. This partially due to laziness, again, and unwillingness to hash out the politically touchy issues, but it's also due to a failing in the US court system. Without a case or controversy, US courts can't issue a ruling. Which is to say that you cannot seek an advisory opinion. Correcting the inability to seek an advisory opinion, even on behalf of Congress, would go a long way to improving many aspects of the US' legislative process. Yeah it is pretty crazy how we've ended up in this situation where nobody can ever really know what the constitution says until there's a lawsuit - sort of the opposite of how laws should work. Hahahahaha; voted for Biden, got punch with both a Left and Right fist! The fuck are you on about? Biden hasn't even been sworn in yet. Congress? So both the Republicans and Democrats are trying to do this? No? Then fucking call it out. So both the Republicans and Democrats are trying to do this? Yes. Members of both parties supports this authoritarian bullshit. No? What do you mean \"No\"?. I JUST fucking said YES. Were you just ASSUMING it was only the Big Bad R, you partisan hack? Can someone eli5 how a bill about something can just contain anything else? Yes, we need to increase the federal school budget by $10 million, and tack on $90 million for weapons for Israel. Ok that's a $100 million education bill. It's just how things been, they are called \"Omnibus Bills\" if you wanna read more. The problem is the US has single.subject rules for state laws, which a number of states use. But that is of course also abused to take down and delay bills that has anything beyond EXACTLY one issue and topic. So I think whatever solution one uses, the politicans will always use them in malice to stall or abuse the system in their favor. This how things have always been.   There is no requirement that all items placed in a bill be related. It's always been wrong, but it serves congresspeople well, so there's never been a serious effort by the legislative branch to reform it. Efforts to curtail it by other branches of government (such as line item vetoes) have been shot down historically as well. Thanks Disney There is much complaining about the president, but I feel the real problem exists with our congress. This is how neoliberals operate. They say what they feel they need to in order to win their elections. After the election, they couldn\u2019t care less about their voters wishes and work to pass whatever they\u2019ve been lobbied to pass. They love sneaking unpopular legislation in like this when they know they can\u2019t pretend it would be good for anyone but the select few that fund their super pacs. You aren\u2019t wrong but republicans do the same thing. Both parties are wicked corrupt. Can everyone in this thread accept that our government on both sides is constantly trying to fuck us over? There's a few on each side who aren't, but fuck me the rest must hate us. No, republicans absolutely do it more than democrats. Democrats do it too, but republicans do it much, much worse. Dont reduce this to such a simple dichotomy. It's not that. Case in point: Democrats want to give more people healthcare, Republicans want to take it away. Its night and day Surprise surprise.. more big name Democrats cosponsoring absolutely inane technology-related bills. Can someone explain this to me like I'm 5? Can someone ELI5 this for me? I read the article, just a bit confused on it. Not sure what copyright trolling is. This is why I don't like the severability doctrine by SCOTUS. I want to tack on a rider to that bill: $30 million of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts A $30,000 fine that doesn't go through court? That literally life-ending right there. Finally get mr Ashit Pai out of the FCC and now this garbage. The sponsor of this bill Rep Hakeem Jeffries Democrat from New York. Surely this has bipartisan support. So politics as usual then. Every politician does this.  Well, kinda. So I guess this will put an end to all of those reaction videos on YouTube. Is this related to the other section 230 story i read today? They sound like different subjects, but the circumstances are the same. (Today, spending bill, section 230) Can I get an unbiased article or ELI5 on this? Hakeem Jeffries [D-NY] and Doug Collins [R-GA] are the lead sponsors in the House, H.R. 2426. You can't get two more polarizing figures in the House yet they could agree on this bill. It passed the House last October, 410-6 which is a very rare instance of a legislative landslide. Then it went to the Senate as S. 1273 where it was hotlined and then held by Sen. Ron Wyden [D-OR]. It has 21 cosponsors in the Senate; 9 D's and 12 R's.  If I remember correctly the idea for the court came from the US Copyright Office about 10 or so years ago. Great Britain has had this style of copyright small claims court for over 6 years now. Of course they are Sounds about right. The US government and 'Doing The Right Thing' go together like oil and water. does their National anthem still has the words \"the land of the free\" in it? I think as an american I would throw up a bit into my mouth if i had to sing that part. Fa la la la la, la la la la Congress and pork barreling: name a better duo Unfortunately what your saying is considered true, but today's times have dictated that truth is no longer important.  Therefore social media companies have now become publishers whether they like it or not. Our country as a whole no longer believes in anything factual or true, just opinion.  Washington D.C. doesn't like the power Big Tech has so regardless of what you or I think, they will get their agenda done one way or another. Block it, fuck them. Let's tear down this shit government, they aren't working for us anymore. Isnit time to pay back the House of Mouse already? What is section 230?:  Briefly,  If it's unconstitutional, then who cares? The courts will naturally just strike it down, no problem. /s How is this shit even allowed? When they say Congress, who added this shit? Reading the article, it doesn't actually seem to be changing a whole lot at all other than possibly streamlining copyright stuff a bit. Companies can already sue private citizens for far more extraneous amounts than the court idea here would allow, and it doesn't provide any instances where it'd actually be bad, even in the article they link for  , other than weird and wild accusations that seem wholly untied to the actual legislation. I mean, I'm all for standing up for private citizens and all that, but...this doesn't actually seem like it's doing anything like what's being claimed, and would be struck down later anyway if it's unconstitutional. Waste of effort. \"big daddy democrat government wouldn't fuck me over \" lol Lets be clear here..    You are completely fucking wrong, the entire idea was the child of a Democrat (Jeffries, from NY), and it has already been overwhelmingly supported in the past by the House (410-6 vote) woops. Generic Democrats are assholes too. Should have voted for more Bernie Sanders/AOC's. Bullets are going to start flying. I\u2019m so fucking sick of this shit Except this was the brainchild of a democrat from NY. Biased redditor pushing nonsense narrative at it again. Mental scenes Oh boy... how bad is it? The sponsor of this bill is a New York Democrat in the Democrat controlled House but nice try You should probably look into this topic if you feel so strongly. The Democrat party is the Party of Wall Street at this point, not the Republicans (I'm independent) For crying out loud, I can't even come to   without a tribal political fight. I'm going to end up unsubscribe to everything Is this really tribal? Who's on the other side of this besides some lobbyists for big content? By congress they mean senate right? This piece of joy was originally passed 410 - 6 in the democrat led House. It was thought up by a NY democrat. Can't just blame pubs this time. Wow.  The bill hasn't even passed yet, and Reddit censors this article from me when I log in.  I literally had to open reddit in a new browser, see this article, then log in on another browser to make this comment. that's not how any of this works Try following the multiple links in the article to previous coverage of the situation. Or we could, ya know, not pass it. If the Republicans want to play this whole \"our way or the highway\" bullshit I am perfectly fine to call their bluff and let this whole place burn. Fuck it.

{"Mick Schumacher to race for Haas in 2021 as famous surname returns to the F1 grid.": ["We created a Discord server for our community and would like to invite all of you to join! You'll be able to discuss sports with users around the world and discuss events in real time! There are separate channels for many sports you can opt in and out of, including; American Football, Soccer, Baseball, Basketball, Aussie Rules Football, Rugby Union and League, Cricket, Motorsports, Fitness, and many more. I hope as fans we can let him grow into the sport and not just put him on an immediate pedestal that he feels he needs to live up to because of the reputation that his name brings. He's still going to be an F1 rookie and he's still human. And he's at Haas. Results will be delayed, to put it mildly. To put it less mildly, he'll be lucky if his brakes fail only once next season I have witnessed the hype Mick already was in his F3 days. No, they will hype it up in F1 even more. Villeneuve didn\u2019t take long I think that\u2019s what happened with Sebastian Vettel. People wanted a Schumacher 2.0. I hope as fans we can let him grow into the sport and not just put him on an immediate pedestal You must be new here. Seeing his name on a Haas car is going to do plenty to temper expectations. Next year will mostly be a test to see if the problem was the drivers or if it was management. Ahhh. To go back to a time when we could all be just human Verstappen, another second generation f1 driver, won his inaugural race and has become one of the most formidable drivers in the field in a very short time. Same.  I am concerned they are promoting him up for ratings and $ due to the attraction of his name.  He has had a couple good years in F2 and F3.  Just hope it is not too soon for the driving and the pressure. I feel like the grid is near half made up of famous surnames nowadays In 2001, we had Verstappen, Schumacher, Raikkonen and Alonso on the grid. Next year we have Verstappen, Schumacher, Raikkonen and Alonso on the grid. Verstappen is the son of a former F1 driver. Same as Mick. And then Sainz is the son of a famous rally driver. It's getting hereditary. F1 kids: I want to be an artist F1 Parents: You will learn the family trade and that is final!! Yeah because the sport is so hard to get into. The main reason Albon drives under the Thai flag instead of the British is because his Thai sponsors are the only reason he's an F1 driver at all. You need money and connections from a young age to be an F1 driver, it's no wonder Seen Lauda\u2019s kid and Senna\u2019s nephew run the circuits in IMSA a couple years ago. no kidding He actually raced before f3 with his mother\u2019s name so he could turn away the publicity, also he doesn\u2019t want to Be compared to his father Real shame he\u2019s gotta drive for haas tho.  That teams been a dumpster fire the past couple seasons But you never know with F1. Last year Racing Point finished 7th in the constructor championship and was considered a mid-field team at best. Then this year they are consistently getting points and even managed to get two podiums, almost three if Checo's car hadn't blow up in the final laps of Bahrain. Maybe Haas manages to build an amazing car out of the blue for 2021. That teams been a dumpster fire Very much so! I know that would make his dad proud. Just checked his progress and it made me tear up. So many years living so dangerously and the furthest thing from ones\u2019 imagination happens. Young Schumacher has some shoes to fill, and I bet he will come close at a minimum. No pressure or anything. Lots of drivers have looked competitive in the lower formulas, and then gone on to do very little in F1. Frentzen and Schumacher Sr were rivals in lower formula with many considering Frentzen to be the quicker driver. Look what happened when they both got to F1. You need a lot of things to fall into place to become F1 champion. He\u2019ll have a lot of pressure because he\u2019s expected to deliver. He\u2019ll have to handle that. Just read up on his dad's progress. Jeez, he is still making progress 7 years after his accident. Hope he continues to improve. Please enlighten me: what has happened with Michael Schumacher? Did he wake up from the coma? Is still in it? As best as I can tell he is not in a coma anymore....several people have said they have spoke with him....however his condition is always described as being very delicate (paraphrasing)....which leads me to believe that he is probably not ambulatory and not very responsive unfortunately (but that\u2019s just my opinion) The family is very secretive about it. And he made no public appearances since the accident. I guess he is in some kind of vegetative state. Meanwhile Perez ( Top 5 pilot imo) will have no team next year. Didn't think that was settled yet. Still possible he could slot in at RedBull He was in beast mode in Bahrain, was fun to watch. He could still go to RB. Top 5 pilot imo No he is not lol With a complete human garbage of a team mate. Whats wrong with Nikita Mazepin? i dont know much about him. Lets not jump to conclusions. Yes things that are out there about him dont make look too great, but maybe f1 will make him mature since he will be among the best of the best. I've been so behind F1 for too many years now, I thought this is the older Schumacher and wondered for a few seconds, how Michael did not age a day. Thankfully I read the article. But really, how does Michael have a 21 y.o. son already? Update: just checked, he's now 51! How time flies. Netflix has a great series on the 2018 and 2019 seasons if you want to catch up Unfortunately he had a terrible accident a few years ago while skiing and suffered a horrible neurological injury. He likely doesn\u2019t know Mick will be racing in F1 or can\u2019t comprehend. Terrible terrible. Lol, I love everybody complaining about nepotism  having no idea that Mick is a former F3 Champion and is leading the F2 Championship. Plenty of undeserving drivers have been given seats, but Mick is not one of them. Of course his family name and money probably helped along the way, but that shouldn\u2019t count against his success Haas is the Cleveland Browns of F1. Change my mind. The Browns are actually doing well this season. They're going to be shit for 20 years then start winning? Hmm, yes. Thats some big shoes to fill! Uncle Ralf set quite the benchmark What ever happened to Ralf.. Still alive and well. Just has never had an F1 seat since 2007. Would be cool if his son made it to F1, Mick and him were the first cousins in F1! His thumbs look so weird in that picture and I can\u2019t get over it I alway has a driver who last name is Schumacher! Netflix drive to survive gonna be thicc with drama despite not having many race to follow Any idea when the next season comes out? It\u2019s happening! wtf is happening with his dad? havent heard any news in years i think the family is super private about affairs. Probably a vegetable or severely incapacitated.  It's been many years since the accident and they have not let even a picture of him come out, or at least that I'm aware of. love it. hate that he has to team up with that entitled douche. keep laughing today thinking about yoda nutting for the first time in 500 years and immediately he starts talking regular again I follow F1 somewhat, but I don't follow the upcoming drivers, anyone who follows, how much of this is deserved and how much of it is because his last name is schumacher? Let's take up a pool, how many races till Lando slams into him? Did Michael ever recover from his ski accident?  Is he still alive? Ngl....I read that as Michael Schumacher to return to F1 and nearly jumped off my chair. Thought I was dreaming. I hope Mick gets all the success he deserves :) I heard this today on the radio The lady very kindly pointed out \"Mick is the son of Michael Schumacher\" So glad she did as I'd never have figured that out for myself Maybe they can come fix our multiple Haas CNC drills that have been down for two weeks FAST. Hope he is nicer to the sport than his dad was. Explain I\u2019m new to f1 He's winning f2 this year, so it's not like he's there just because of who his father is You mean Damon Hill the son of Graham Hill? Even Lewis Hamilton\u2019s half brother is racing in BTCC. However he never seems to finish a race. I must say Nicholas Hamilton does have cerebral palsy. I think it\u2019s wonderful to have someone with such disability compete in motorsport. I just can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s only because of his famous name that he has been given the opportunity. That was several years ago. Bruno Senna raced from 2010-2012, but he never drove for a particularly good team. He\u2019s now having some success in the World Endurance Championship Edit: I was reminded that he did in fact score points, mostly in the Williams in 2012 Anyone ever notice in 'The Expanse' Alex, the pilot, calls Holden \"Haas\" several times. Is this the source of the expression? Hoss is a slang word for horse. Basically calling the person big, strong, and dependable. He's leading the F2 championship. Totally outrageous that Perez has no seat, but this guy gets to race.  He\u2019s not the famous Schumacher. The soccer fandom is leaking Nepotism doesn't explain away an F3 championship and a current lead in the F2 championship. Both are spec series, so driver skill shines through way more. Yes being the son of one of the greatest drivers of all time gave him opportunities, but opportunities don't mean shit without talent and hard work, especially given modern super license requirements Mick Schumacher is literally leading F2. Out of junior drivers he is literally the best. He's leading the f2 championships which is a feeder to f1. Yes he's had the advantage of being born to a successful father, but he's actually a very good driver. Yes, it\u2019s true that having that surname will bring sponsors and contacts, but the guy is good. Same thing happened with Verstappen, he\u2019s the son of a F1 driver, but he\u2019s probably the best/2nd best driver in the grid. If your father is short, has good reflexes and amazing hand eye coordination, you probably will have that too. If you add this to his experience helping you grow as a driver, you can see that this is a great advantage. Is F1 not a sport? Go for a lap in one of those beasts and then come back and tell us if it\u2019s a sport... your neck will fall off after the first turn. ", "Sports"], "Topic": "Sports"}
