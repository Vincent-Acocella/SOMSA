          Our team is comprised of five senior undergraduate students at Marist College. SOMSA was developed as a part
          of our senior capstone project advised by Dr. Juan Arias. <br /><br />The objective of SOMSA was to create a
          machine learning powered web application that would return the sentiment and confidence interval of popular
          events from around the world. Our data was acquired from popular social media sites using a in-house web
          crawler.<br /><br />We developed our system during the fall semester of 2020. Now time to meet our team!<br /><br />
